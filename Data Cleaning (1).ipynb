       "[\"Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. \\n\\nAfter reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato purée and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. \\n\\nManagement also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.\",\n",

       " \"Disappointing. Bolt is a follow up of Fanny's Fabrics, which closed. Like Fanny's, the selection is small. The fabrics lean toward contemporary. They also have a small stock of fabrics that you can order; however, they don't have enough room to display their selections, so it's like trying to paw through your closet when it has twice as many clothes as the racks were meant to handle. \\n\\nThe woman who works there most of the time is very nice and helpful. However, my mother and I both bought fabric there, and we both had the same problem: the employee helped us calculate our yardage without taking the repeat into consideration. I brought my pillow forms with me, so there was no doubt exactly how large they were. My mother was able to make her project work, but I came up a pillow short. By the time the pillows were made, I realized I was short, and I returned to Bolt (all in a month's time), the fabric had sold out, with no plans on reordering. \\n\\nFortunately for me, I was just making a number of large throw pillows. Now I don't have the number I wanted, but I can be flexible. What if this had been an upholstery job and my piece was partially completed? Obviously, unacceptable. My advise is to feel free and shop here, but figure out your measurements on your own.\",\n",
       " \"I have been here twice and have had really good food and service both times. I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.\\n\\nThe second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever.\\n\\nThe only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.\\n\\nThe last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don't make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It's also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street.\",\n",

He could not pick the lock which is not unusual and said he would have to drill through the lock. Ok. But, failed to bring charged batteries. He never offered to come back with charged batteries as soon as he could nor offered to send someone else. He said he could, however, come back around 10 hours later and do it \"under-the-table.\" Usually when you need to get a lock off, you need it off that minute. I said no. He charged me $30 for a service fee...a service that I never received. I contacted the manager, which seems to be a task in itself, and he said that I was rightfully charged $30 because I \"refused\" the technician\\'s offer to come back later.

When my boyfriend arrived a few minutes later, we didn't see Vanessa behind the bar so we tried to flag down her male coworker. He was caught up watching the fight and it took a few minutes to get his attention - which is fine. Not fine, however, is that after I ordered a beer, he stood and texted for a few minutes before getting my beer and held his arm up to shield his texting from management lol. \\n\\nVanessa, however, is an excellent bartender!! As loud as it is in this place, she continually scanned the bar looking for people attempting to make eye contact with her for service.

The staff were all extremely nice, remembered me like I was an old friend, and generally made me feel very comfortable. It's also great that they have Saturday appointments. The evaluation, as with most lasik places, was complementary and all followup exams and treatments are included.  These exams are generally about 10 minutes.\\n\\nThe pre-surgery paperwork and going over post-op details, etc took about 30 minutes and the surgery itself (both eyes) took 25 minutes. Numbing drops are applied, so there is no pain, but while the flap is being created, there is an intense feeling of pressure from the suction that holds your eye still. I hated that. Afterward, the only pain I experienced was similar to getting soap in my eye, a kind of stinging. I went home and slept all night and woke up the next morning for my first followup and I could see! And had no more burning! I had some broken blood vessels from the suction used to hold my eye in place, but no pain all week, just dry eyes. The week following, you must avoid swimming, exercise, eye makeup, and have to sleep with goggles (so you don't rub your eyes) and apply drops almost constantly. \\n\\nI believe I've made a great investment. I still can't believe I'm going to see this well FOREVER! :-) \\n\\nMy only complaint was that they didn't administer a sedative or anything to help me relax during the surgery (and maybe a pain Rx for after?)

We all sat in the bar area, the group just kinda grew as people filtered in, and nowhere on the menu does it mention anything about an auto-add for \"big parties.\" Besides, I thought it was insulting because pretty much everyone at the table goes there a lot or at least often-enough to have talked with Ron and be a pretty familiar \"face\" - and we\\'re Yelpers, so we\\'re gonna tip you (oh, and PS? Not everyone ordered the $5 special, like Kathleen M. with her shrimp-n-grits or Lauren S. with her breakfast bowl . . . no one was gonna stiff them!).\\n\\nStill, our first three dining companions left without much fanfare, and I figured, \"hey, bad night.\" Then . . . the rest of us got ready to leave and a) our server took for-freakin\\'-ever to bring checks, and b) (the last straw in my book) dropped Emily R.\\'s to-go box on the floor, picked it up and resealed it, and dropped it in front of her like nothing had happened. Oh, did I mention that while we were waiting on our checks, we got to see several other servers (note: not ours) eating some of Ron\\'s wings at the bar with \"regulars\" (as he later described them)?? Yeah, it was a BAD night at Rosebud.\\n\\nSo when our server finally came back with the checks, I spoke up. My intention was to let him know that we were \"nonplussed\" and, as I stated to him, he should remove the \"automatic 20% service charge if he\\'d included it.\" A couple minutes later, Ron came out to \"chat.\"\\n\\nI have to say . . . I\\'m \"a little bit embarrassed\" because I\\'m not the diner who wants her meal comped for any little reason, or, really, ever, unless it\\'s a gracious gesture on management\\'s part. And when Ron came over, it felt, well, like our server had tattled to Daddy . . . and that Ron didn\\'t really want to hear what had happened. He said most of the right things, and \"agreed\" with comments, but suddenly I felt like I was the only one speaking up, he didn\\'t *really* care, he noted he\\'d worked \"80 or 90 hours\" in the last week (ok, but you\\'re the owner, right? The resto business is nothing close to easy . . . what does that have to do with our conversation??), and he tried to defend his server as well as justify the service charge . . . and then he said \"I can see where this is going . . . let me just take care of all of your dinners.\"\\n\\nWell, sh*t. Not really what I wanted to have happen. Honestly, it just seemed like an easy out to get *me* (us) to STHU. And then . . . how do I tip on a non-dinner? Especially one where I just had Bloody Mary\\'s once noting how sloooow everyone\\'s food orders came, despite being tempted? And do I just take it as a \"freebie\" given my week of Eat On $30 challengedom?? It was all too much. It seemed we all left awkwardly (not to mention that Kathleen, James, and Lauren had to pay, including a \"service charge\" and we didn\\'t) and while Emily \"tipped for me\" since I didn\\'t eat, but she knew I felt weird, I left with the overall thought . . . \"Huh?? What just happened??\"\\n\\nMonday. I will chalk it all up to Monday. I really like Rosebud and want to continue going often and recommending it to folks, but I left feeling -and still feel - like I need to *digest* my most recent experience . . .',\n",

I read about tomatillos a while ago online, and since then I\\'ve been curious to try it. After a productive study session, I went with a friend here for lunch. Their special sounded tempting, but after having seen their menu online, I\\'ve been dying to try their potato and green chile burrito, so that\\'s what I ordered. Since we were there for lunch, the guy at the counter told me they actually had a lunch special where for $8 you could get a burrito, chips and a drink. Sounded like a pretty good deal, so I got it. This is where I hand it to them. I assumed that all the extra toppings cost, well, extra, but there was no longer a price written next to them like there was on the menu I saw online. I then found out that they aren\\'t, so I also got roasted corn and avocado added to my burrito (I didn\\'t want to add too much and have the burrito be untenably huge!). My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and had like four extra toppings added to his.\\n\\nThere were a couple of minor things that bothered me. After ordering at the counter, I wasn\\'t sure if I was supposed to go up and get my burrito once they called it out, or if I was supposed to wait for someone to bring it to me. There\\'s nothing stated anywhere, and they surely didn\\'t say anything, so I just went up and got it. But then a couple after us had their food brought to them by the guy at the counter. Hmm. Odd. I was also kinda \"meh\" on the salsa at the table, and the chips that came with my lunch special. The chips tasted a little greasy to me, and the salsas just weren\\'t that great. I was expecting the tomatillo salsa to be amazing, considering the name of the restaurant was called tomatillos. Instead, it just tasted like they added waaaaaaaaay too much lime juice to me. I cannot remember a single thing about the red salsa, which just is a bad sign, considering I ate there like 3 hours ago.\\n\\nI will say though, that the potato and green chile was AMAZING. Definitely the best parts of the burrito were the very nicely seasoned potatoes, and the absolutely delicious blend of cheese they used inside. Pinto beans were nicely cooked, too.

The Sellwood consisted of a beef, patty, bacon, aged sheddar, caramelized onions, butter lettuce, aioli and the Hawthorne had a beef patty, bacon, goat cheese, strawberry preserves on Brioche.  Of course, she wanted to share the Hawthorne.  I took a bite of the Hawthorne first and didn't want to give the rest to her.  It was so succulent!  The sweetness of the preserves with the tang of the goat cheese complimented the medium-rare beef patty well.  My sister didn't care for the Morrison, she felt that it was something that she could've made at home and the Sellwood was delicious but very typical burger flavors.  Love that their truffle fries are super crispy!  I think there will be more Hawthorne burgers in my future. While sitting at the benches eating, I was surprise that they get a lot weird people constantly walking by for that area.\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I have done business with Beaverton Toyota 3 times and each time, they've blown me away at the service they've provided (I mean that in a good way). We've had the following salesman help us over the years - Mo Jafari, Salah Husein, and Drew (can't remember his last name)....and we can't forget the one who has always been the one to 'make it all happen' - Josh Ford ( who was once the Sales Manager and now is a one of the Finance Managers). Each time we've gone in there, we presented them with some pretty tough challenges as to what we want to get out of and get in to, the negative equity that always seems to be involved, and the little down payment we never seem to have. But no matter how impossible our requests have seemed, they have always welcomed the challenges and have gone above and beyond to 'make it happen' for us and make sure we leave their lot a happy (and returning) customer. Just to share an example: My husband wanted a car on a Subaru lot really bad! But that dealership wouldn't give him the amount he wanted for his trade-in, so the numbers didn't work, which means he couldn't get the car. Well, when we told Beaverton Toyota about it, they went over to that Subaru lot, bought the car, brought it back to their lot, gave my husband what he was asking for his trade-in, and sold him the Subaru themselves! We were in shock and awe at how above and beyond they went. They don't try to convince you to 'settle for something else' because what you really want is too much of a challenge in making the numbers work. Their attitudes are 'BRING IT!' When it comes to the sales part of their jobs, they aren't pushy at all, annoying, or smothering, which I for one can highly appreciate as I HATE the car buying process (despite the fact that I've traded a car in almost every year for the past few years)! They show and express that they really care about what it is YOU want and also show that your safety and comfort (and that of your passengers) is important to them as well. They are always very patient (I speak from experience as I am not the easiest person to do business with), respectful, professional, and relaxed. If I ever had an issue with a car after purchasing it (which is rare), they are all over taking care of it like white on rice! \\nI brag about these guys to everyone I know. They deserve it. I've been to so many other dealerships and I've never have had the kind of experience with them that I do with Beaverton Toyota. I think, given all the cars I've had over the past few years, and the fact that I LOVE the Toyota they put me in to recently, it will be a long while before I do any car shopping. But if and when I decide to car shop again, I won't be going anywhere else but there.\",\n",

It's not my imagination because my wife noticed my plate and said the same thing.  \\n\\nI ordered a combo plate that you can choose up to four items.  I wanted three, and asked to just double up on the eggplant (which I ALWAYS do). The waitress said there would be a $2 up charge to double eggplant or babaganoush.  I looked at the menu, and the appetizer portion (which is bigger than the combo portion) of eggplant is only $1 more than the other items.  So where did the other dollar come from??  The babaganoush was the exact same price on the appetizer menu as the other items!  So where did the $2 up charge come from??  It made no sense to me whatsoever, but I did't feel like arguing about it.  Even if there was a legitimate reason for the up charge, they should have it on the menu, like they do for grape leaves.  \\n\\nThe whole thing put a bad taste in my mouth.

I came here for the burnt ends, because FYI, it is very hard to find burnt ends around Atlanta.  this place offered them so I came.  They were sub par in my opinion.  They were 1.5 inch cubes of dry brisket black on all sides.  This is not the burnt ends I know and love.  Definite disappointment when that was my sole purpose for coming there.\\n\\nOther lackluster food: the brunswick stew was just okay... tasted and looked like something you would get out of a can.  The potato salad had pretty much no flavor and the potato seemed slightly undercooked.\\n\\nThe good food:  I really enjoyed the okra.  I love okra, and whenever I order fried okra I assume it's going to be sliced and in corn meal.  However, they fry it whole and in almost a tempura type batter.  Very different and very tasty.  We ordered some wings and they were very good.  They're smoked and then flash fried so they are flavorful and juicy.  However, I recommend getting them in a sauce because the dry rub just isn't enough.  The pulled pork was also very good, but a little dry like it was pulled long before I ordered it.\\n\\nOn top of food shortcomings, there were several service issues.  The server, although very nice and polite,. was the only server working the lunch shift.  So she was obviously overwhelmed by five or six tables.  On top of that, our bill was mixed with the table next to us so when I got my bill it was over 80 dollars for the two of us.  She fixed it, but it caused a longer delay than there already was.  The service issues really weren't her fault, but management for only having one server, that was also acting as the bartender.\\n\\nIf I'm in the area and needing some bbq I would definitely come here again.

In addition to taking my picture at deal end, I was treated like a princess descended from elite royalty.  I was provided the finest of coffee and offered sugary confections whilst we negotiated.

The Salespeople were efficient but I need more than that.  I need entertainment and a feeling of victory when I purchase things in this price bracket.  I crave these things, like people crave sugar and that feeling of fullness after stuffing oneself at the annual turkey dinner.  I need to wave my keys around and strut... because I bought this car.  Finally after years of denying myself the luxury of heated seats, I have given in.  I am one with the universe now...  I am a diva and my bottom is warmed... all because of my new Honda.  There needs to be much celebration.

All that was missing was a huge table of fresh pastries and a DJ playing that awful macarana coordinated dance crap that I was forced to participate in.  I felt just a tad out of place in my torn jeans, high topped converse sneakers and unicorn cat t-shirt.  I think there was some grandiose plumbing fixtures in the ladies room that reminded me of those high priced remodeling jobs you see on HGTV.

During the first five minutes of our ceremony, he somehow managed to get across the building, up to a balcony, and back; he took beautiful photos of the unveiling and gorgeous panoramas showing all of our guests, and he returned before our officiant's welcome was over.  We got a glimpse of how he did it from a video of our recessional, in which he silently sprints along the side of the building to get both our first kiss and our walk up the aisle.  It couldn't have been more different from my parents' horror story, and we couldn't imagine better photographs.\\n\\nSeeing his site (http://www.channingjohnsonblog.com) is probably more convincing than reading this review.  We were swayed both by the impressive portfolio and by our first meeting with him, and we liked him so much that we decided to do an engagement session as well.  During that session, he set two nervous subjects at ease, and we ended up with a spectacular set of photos.  We gave them to our parents and grandparents at the wedding, and they were thrilled.\\n\\nFinally, working with Channing is a joy.  He is incredibly responsive and endlessly thoughtful, and he clearly cares about what he does.  He listened closely to all of our requests and concerns, and he dealt tactfully with a couple of our friends and family who insisted that he ought to take a particular picture in a particular way.  Our engagement and wedding photos came promptly, with the files mailed on disc and loaded on an online gallery.\\n\\nSo yes, Channing is a ninja.  He is everywhere and seems to be nowhere; he has consummate skill in his art; he is awesome.\",\n",

       " \"I was surprised when I read the reviews of MM, but after using them for my initial CPAP experience and then follow on visits, I learned a lot. When I was first looking for a provider, I was determined to get one that took all of our insurance. I started cross walking providers and finally hit MM. Obtaining approvals was a snap. Equipment and supplies delivered promptly and I made a point of stopping by for small adjustments or advice. I only have used the Manchaca location. Initially, phone calls were routed to the Stafford call center (outside of Houston I believe), and messages that were left were apparently not being forwarded to this location and there were email issues (thank you YELP reviewers for the head's up). I originally made an appointment at this location for a face to face and to confirm all insurance info. I was quite pleased, learned a lot, and prepped myself about equipment for meeting with the doctor and discussing the prescription. I always made an appointment, just to keep things easy. Now they have a new phone system installed which goes directly to that small office or if they are tied up with an appointment it goes to the north office. This has been a major factor in my rating as it is much easier to contact the specific person i want. Since this is a very small office they prioritize. Appointments first, walk-ins second. Since supplies come out of the Houston area warehouse I anticipated long delays. It appears that they are addressing warehouse issues down there, but I still maintain contact only with the Manchaca location. I am quite surprised to have a good experience so far as I was dreading dealing with this issue. I will try to update this after a few more months to see I continue to be pleased.\\n\\nI did a lot of checking on providers and came up with a lot of bad ones. However, those that appear to have good ratings, may not take your insurance. The highest rated one took none of ours. That would mean everything out of pocket.\",\n",

It was a dragon which I had done circa 1997/1998 by a now well known tattoo artist.  A friend of mine stenciled a dragon on me, and instead of removing it I had to worked over. It was fine and barely visible until touched by then known as \"Naton\" of Dark wave Dermagraphics  located in his loft at Dudley Station in Boston, when tattooing was illegal. \\n\\nI left with a horrible tattoo. A marriage of pain and torment which I lived in.  I had tried endless times to have it redone and was always told it couldn\\'t be done,  until Neil came along....\\n\\nAbout Empire Tattoo....it stepped in to seal the deal, and get a brutal, bloody, long overdue divorce from this tattoo.  I sat in an ultra cushiony soft leather sofa which immediately made me sleepy.  The studio was clean,  spacious, and all employees friendly.  \\n\\nAbout Neil....HE IS THE REAL DEAL. He takes time to analyze your existing tattoo and discusses the options.  He is a real artist.  His work space was awesome.  He calmed me with movies, we watched Push, and Casino Jack.  He has outlets to charge your cell phone,  art everywhere,  and is not only am awesome tattoo artist but a great person. He is a family man and proud of his wife, who is a true artist also. \\n\\nThe vibe in the studio is awesome,  positive energy and even the owner is very cool! When done, Neil sealed the deal and filed my tattoo nightmare divorce by wrapping me up in Saran wrap. I am sooooo happy, I cried out of happiness and also pain, lol. When done I got a care package of tattoo balm which increased my healing time and a cool t-shirt which I wear often with pride. \\n\\nGo with cash, I had to use an atm across the street, no biggie, but we all know cash is king!! Have cash to tip also, these people are artists and cash tips are necessary!\\n\\nLastly there is ample parking across the street adjacent to advance auto. Do not park in advances\\' parking lot, park on the public street or risk being towed!!!\\n\\nI look forward to rebooking with Neil.  Follow him on Facebook and instagram to see if he has cancelations. His appointments are COVETED,  do not rush him and do not miss your appointment.\\n\\nEmpire tattoo is clean,  friendly and professional.  \\nI have been in a few places and left running...Empire IS THE ONLY PLACE YOU NEED TO GO FOR A TATTOO  and I highly recommend Neil. The other artists seemed great too, but it\\'s the work of NEIL ENGLAND,  that I wear with pride...thanks Neil....',\n",

I ordered the house pho, took my number and headed downstairs. Set in five points, this place is busy but they have plenty of seating. The pho was delivered shortly after i found a seat. The broth at first taste is a bit sweet and doesn't exactly have a beefy, pho taste. I will say that once lime, basil, and a bit of chili oil were added, the flavor developed and became more savory.  The flank was well done when it got to the table. I would suggest meatball or the brisket before the flank. While this was not my favorite pho, it still hit the spot and provided a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of attending a conference.\",\n",

Their cleaning employees are nice people, but awfully unprofessional and with absolutely no training.  They are basically just told to show up. There are no standards by which they must adhere, even in regards to what supplies they bring.   \\n\\nThe last cleaner I had brought a single rag with stains and hair on it, to clean everything, even the bathroom...and no paper towels. I opted to give her my counter cloths to use for the kitchen at least, but couldn\\'t find it after she left.. so I guess she took it with her!   \\nSince she presumably used the same rag in the toilet as everywhere else... I had to clean AGAIN after she left. \\n\\nThe WORST part is the customer service and overall company interaction.  \\n\\nFirst cleaning  - I booked using a referral promo.   I have the screenshot of what I was supposed to be charged - when I made the booking. However the charge on my credit card was DOUBLE.  **Customer service said the quoted price was due to an error in their website design and thanked me for bringing in to their attention..but did not refund me the balance.   The cleaning was just ok, but I opted to give it another try..BIG MISTAKE.  \\n\\nThe second cleaning:  I had a scheduling conflict and moved the cleaning by 2 hours: the online system confirmed that I would be charged a $15 fee.  However, the schedule change did not take effect, they showed up when I was not home, and my whole payment was wasted.  **Customer service told me \"nothing was rescheduled\"...they don\\'t know why the system did not register it..no compensation offered.\\n\\nThe 3rd cleaning: The pro, Omar, started by texting that he was running late.  Then he texted that he could not come due to police activity in the T and HIS WORDS: \\' the situation is a lil risky for me\\'.    I called customer service and they confirmed that he would not be coming.  They told me they would refund my credit card the full amount paid for the cleaning and also issue me a $35 goodwill credit since my whole afternoon was wasted waiting for him.   \\n**The credit card refund never showed up, and when I called 2 weeks later, customer service told me that they just gave me a goodwill credit because the pro \\'was late\\'!  \\nI told them that in fact he NEVER showed up **I have his messages to prove it, and I HAD been told I was going to get the full refund to my credit card.   \\n**They refused to refund the full amount. I asked them if they have customer service calls recorded, so that they can go back to Sep 16 and listen to what I was told.  The woman told me that her manager said yes they have the calls recorded, but he will not listen to them, and that she was \\'proceeding to cancel this call\\'.. AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  \\n\\nNeedless to say I will NEVER refer anyone to Handy.

I can understand if the place is jamming, but it was dead in there at 8 PM.  Maybe the staff should spend less time hanging out together behind the bar, flexing, talking about drinking and plans for later and spend some time doing their jobs.

Jeff and Kevin showed up on time and did a one minute scan of our stuff, coming up with a mental plan for how to pack the truck in the most efficient way.

The approach to our new apartment is challenging, with multiple sets of stairs and gravel to deal with. They handled these with ease. The trickiest part was our giant overstuffed leather couch which was actually bigger than the door or the stairway. Although they weren't 100% sure it would fit, they gave it a shot and through a series of clever maneuvers they got it up the stairs and into place. The best testament to their professionalism is that as they were headed back to the truck after spending 15 minutes muscling our couch up a pretty insane set of stairs, they weren't complaining, they were complimenting each other on a tough problem well solved.

He explained everything, from how to blow dry to how to use the products to get the look I wanted. He was extremely professional, fun to talk to, and most importantly, extremely talented.

The walls and flooring are thin, or maybe they didn't put padding down when installing the carpet because it always sounds like an earthquake or WWF match coming from upstairs. I could hear a pin drop from upstairs-- I hear everything. Whoever is in charge of beautification of the neighborhood does a decent job, but they tend to neglect the breezeways and apartments that are on the back side of the building. I am constantly picking up garbage and trash bags -- yes, trash bags that have been tossed from someone's balcony and into the wooded area. Just because I don't live in the front of the building where everything is visible, doesn't mean I want to see trash every time I open my front door or look outside my window. I've complained about this several times and I'm always told that a $25 fee will be charged to the people who do this and that they will investigate the trash bags to find the culprit, but I know this isn't being done. Overall, we feel safe and have not heard of any dangerous incidents happening here, so that is definitely a pro. I can walk to the grocery store and run on a treadmill in the fitness center if I don't feel like driving to my gym. The leasing office and entrance of the neighborhood is nice. Too bad the apartments aren't just as nice, but you get what you pay for. They know us in the leasing office and at corporate. I don't think it means anything though. My roommate and I have learned to make the best of our living situation and I have hope that things will get better.\",\n",

Ma Soba, a pan-Asian and sushi restaurant in Beacon Hill.  Opened in 1999, the restaurant has an impressive array of awards.  Needless to say, we were pretty excited to try it out.\\n\\nWe were greeted at the door by a friendly face, but his was the last smile we would see that evening.  Our server ignored us for several minutes after stopping by just long enough to fill our water glasses, and when she did return, only wanted to know if we had \"decided what we wanted\".  She took our order and left.  Not that she didn\\'t do her job well; she was tremendously efficient.  Our water glasses were full all night, and she timed the courses perfectly.  But a smile and a little hospitality certainly would have made us feel a lot more comfortable.\\n\\nWe hit a home run with our appetizers.  My boyfriend ordered the pork gyoza, and they were crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside.  My miso soup was excellent.  For our main course, we split the Shogun Boat, which consisted of eight pieces of Sushi, fifteen pieces of Sashimi, a Tuna Roll, a Caterpillar Roll and a California Roll.  Now, we knew Ma Soba was not the top sushi restaurant in Boston.  It\\'s not too pricey, so we knew not to expect phenomenal sushi.  With that in mind, we were very pleased with the presentation, the selection and the quality.  We were quite content after our main course, even if our server had yet to crack a smile.  \\n\\nHowever, the biggest disappointment was yet to come.  We ordered the green tea mochi, and we were horrified when my boyfriend\\'s fork made a resounding \"clank\" against  it as he tried to cut into it.  I attempted a bite of my piece, but after chunks of freezer burn ice fell into my mouth, decided to follow my better judgment and send the mochi back.  We were disappointed that the restaurant even served us such sub-standard fare.\\n\\nWe left disappointed.

The quesadilla salad was thrown onto the place and looked like someone had bumped the plate or almost dropped it or something. The chicken was thick and rubbery. \\n\\nI know this place is in tourist central so maybe they don't have to pay much attention to quality on account that people will come regardless because they won't know, but we definitely won't be back here!

The beers are arranged by location, it seems.  There's an Austin/Texas area, moving into a US microbrew-ish area.  Across the aisle are the imports from Italy, Canada, Holland, Germany, and the like.  The Asian beers were off in another aisle, across from the oh-so-yucky Anheiser-Busch products and the like.  There was also a somewhat impressive selection of Mexican beers.\\n\\nI was overwhelmed by the wine selections.  They have everything that your oenophile heart could ever desire.

I have no doubt if he or someone with a similar skill set was in the kitchen, Flip Burger would be 5 stars.  You are giving 5 star ingredients to a burger flipper, which isn't quite going to cut it.\\n\\nWe started off with the poutine appetizer.  Poutine is popping up everywhere lately.  This version was underwhelming.  There really wasn't any meat in this dish.  The fries are cooked in beef fat and the gravy is chorizo based, but I couldn't find much chorizo in it.  It should also have cheese curds, but those were absent as well.  What we had here was a savory creamy sauce poured over french fries, topped with two fried eggs.  Unfortunately the egg whites were still runny, which I'm not a fan of.  It's amazing that it's so hard for a cook to get the yolks runny and the whites cooked.  There was plenty of fries so my buddy and I kind of just left the ones that were touched by the clear uncooked egg white.  2 stars  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=nxZc_vqqUeAxzWFcWMhzXQ\\n\\nI was very excited to try a Milkshake here, specifically the Krispy Kreme shake.  I don't know if they blend up an whole Krispy Kreme glazed donut in there, but it sure tasted exactly like drinking one.  It was delicious.  My only disappointment was at the use of the liquid nitrogen.  Of course if you've watched Richard Blais on Top Chef, you know he enjoys using it.  So these shakes have Liquid Nitrogen added to them.  Unfortunately this molecular gastronomy technique was left to our server/ hostess.  It consisted of her pouring a little bit of liquid nitrogen over the top of the milkshake, which made it smoke a little bit.  This can't be what Blais intends here, as it added nothing but a little flair.  I've had ice cream blasted with liquid nitrogen before and it's usually used to get a crunchy outer shell, which would have offered an interesting texture.  It also can be added to the process of making ice cream which lends itself to smaller crystals, thus giving it a smoother texture.  This was a pretty smooth creamy shake, so perhaps that's what's going on here.  The top of my shake that had the liquid nitrogen poured on it was a goopy mess.  4 stars  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=V7XgrE_YOV-BkIJe2xLdXg\\n\\nAs for the burger, I went with the Earth & Turf Burger.  This patty is a blend of ground beef and ground mushrooms, and I loved the blend.  It was topped with caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms, gruyere cheese, pickles, and a delicious mushroom mayo.  Lots of little chopped up pieces of mushrooms were mixed in with the mayo.  If you love mushrooms, this is your burger.  I ordered it medium rare.  From the first bite, I thought this is a 5 star burger and outstanding.  Unfortunately the burger flipper, didn't give me a medium rare burger, or even a medium burger.  It was closer to medium well, and fully cooked all the way through.  Now the quality of the beef saved it.  It was still very juicy and I enjoyed every bite.  However, the burger flipper's job is to do one thing, and that's pretty much cook a burger correctly.  A real chef wouldn't have messed that up.  Even still I'm giving this burger 4.5 stars.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=YAVwD_oolsY8kSVS4LAnhQ\\n\\nMy buddy also enjoyed his burger, but it was also medium well, rather than the medium rare he ordered.  We were the first diners of the day and ours were the only burgers the cook had to pay attention to, so it's not like he lost track of them.  Oh well, that's the problem with a chain style restaurant where the Top Chef is absent.  And lack of execution keeps Flip Burger from getting 5 stars from me.  But I'll be happy to eat that over cooked mushroom burger anytime.\\n\\n*Also of note, they say they are open until 11pm, but we were turned away at 10:45 pm, which we weren't too happy about.  If you don't want to take customers up until your closing time, then change your closing time to when you do want to take them.  10:30 or whatever.  But to turn someone away while you are technically still open, only ticks off the customer.  We almost didn't return the next day after being treated like that.  Most people wouldn't have.\",\n",

Last March I got my third keratin treatment in two years. I paid $250. The week before that I had gotten a cut, color, highlight and blow dry and bought some products. With tips, I spent close to $600.00 in two weeks. When I washed my hair a couple of days after the keratin my new highlights were brassy blonde and completely burnt and shriveled up. I had to straighten my hair but it looked terrible! I went to the salon and elie agreed to fix it. He toned down the highlights and cut my hair really short trying to cut the fried hair out but it still looked terrible. When I went back for my next cut I told him I was really upset and he assured me he was going to fix it. Not only did he not fix it, because it can't be fixed, but he charged me. The next appointment I made with him he cancelled and I had to go to somebody else because I couldn't get another appointment for weeks. So when I was getting close to needing another haircut I went into the salon and made an appointment and I told him I was upset about all the money I paid for the keratin. He said we will talk when you come in for appointment. I went in the following week for my appointment on a Monday and he had called in sick. I asked when next appointment was and they couldn't offer me anything til Friday at 4:30! I told receptionist I work til 5pm and could be there at 5:15 and she said sorry, he is booked.

Everything is seasonal.\"  Then he walked away and started talking to a coworker and stocking the bar before we even had a chance to respond.  Rude.

I eventually went for the awesome looking brunch menu and ordered way too much for two people:\\n\\n- Pulled Pork Corn Muffin ($6)\\nThis is listed under sides, but it came out first and was a really delicious start to the meal. It's less like a corn muffin, and more like just a ton of pork with some guacamole on delicious bread.\\n\\n- Sunrise Poutine ($15)\\nI told myself that this was a starter, so I wouldn't feel horrendous for ordering three entrees. This is way more than an appetizer and is a meal on its own. This consists of a hot pile of fries covered in scrambled eggs, gravy, cheese curds and Canadian bacon. I often regret ordering poutine when I'm left with half a plate of pure mush and sogginess, but that was not the case here at all - this was some of the best poutine I've ever had, as the fries remained super crispy throughout and were incredibly good combined with the salty Canadian bacon and the fluffy eggs.\\n\\n- Sunnyside Burger ($15)\\nAs if we didn't get enough bacon, egg and cheese with the poutine, we also had this excellent burger with plenty more of the same piled on top of it. This was a really outstanding burger. The sunnyside egg on top was nice and runny and was just perfect with the bacon and American cheese.\\n\\n- Southern Belle French Toast ($12)\\nAnother really excellent choice, this french toast came with two huge, juicy chicken breasts on top of it. The jalapeno jelly was a little strange, but aside from that, the chicken and french toast combo was just as good, if not better than the standard chicken and waffles.\\n\\nIt's a pretty hipstery crowd with hipstery, slightly lazy service. It's a fun, energetic atmosphere though, which combined with all that delicious  food makes you look past these slight flaws and yearn to return to try more great stuff.\",\n",

The special Whalburger sauce that came with it (thousand island) was good.....helped to give the burger some taste.  \\n\\nSo, that's that.......I'll check the place out again if Marky Mark will buy me a beer.

I ordered the Eggs Benny and added the heirloom tomato slice which was an additional $2 fucking dollars. I thought it was an above average eggs benny, not the best I've ever had but not bad by any means. The potatoes that came with it were really well seasoned and crispy.\\n\\nI also shared the burger, which was really good and had Laurelhurst Market bacon, pickled zucchini, and heirloom tomatoes on it. The burger was good, but the bacon and veggies were what really made it. My only qualm was that the bun was way to big proportionally to the burger inside.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was pretty cool, it was kind of industrial with brick walls and in a partial basement. Service was good overall but I couldn't hear the server at all, I just kind of nodded through our entire interaction until I left.\",\n",

The meatloaf was tender and juicy, the mashed potatoes were so flavorful and the mushroom gravy and fried onions only made it better. The service was amazing as well.

       " \"I decided to take my laptop to MacTronics based on a friends recommendation.  The issue with my Macbook Pro: My screen kept freezing and finally after two weeks it just stopped booting up.  Normally this would be a sensible conclusion that my hard drive was fried.  However, I installed an SSD a few years ago and those things rarely crash.  So I took it to MacTronics and explained that I wasn't sure what was wrong with the laptop but I assumed it was the hard drive even though it was SSD.  I was informed for them to run an diagnostics test on the laptop it would cost me 60 bucks.  If that came up with nothing they would need to open the laptop up that would be an additional 30 bucks.  I received a call two days later and I was politely told that they couldn't find out what was wrong with my laptop but they assumed it was the hard drive.  Which is what I assumed before I dropped my laptop off!  They also told me that I was 90 bucks in so far and that the next step was to erase my hard drive and reformat it to see if it was actually the hard drive.  The next step would cost me an additional 60 bucks bringing my total to 150 bucks.  When I asked if erasing my data was necessary they told me yes in order to keep troubleshooting.  I refused because I know that I can erase my own data, go to the Apple store and they can reformat my hard drive for free!  So I picked up my laptop, paid 90 bucks, and went to the Apple store.  First off, Apple ran two different diagnostics tests FOR FREE!!.  They also told me that because I installed my own hard drive that the diagnostics test will always show my hard drive as an error so they were looking for other errors.  They also agreed that SSD hard drives rarely crash so they wanted to take a look inside my Macbook Pro overnight FREE of charge.  I got a call the next day from Apple saying my laptop was fixed by merely replacing the cable that connects the hard drive to the motherboard!  Data Saved!  And it cost me 57 bucks!!  If you have an Apple device that is less than 6 years old DO NOT TAKE IT TO THIS PLACE unless you need data recovery.\",\n",

In fact, we were about to forget our things we bought at Uncommon Objects and one of the waiters was quick to tell us we almost forget our bags!

The waiting area (only for people getting their car detailed or getting the Full Service interior cleaning) is nice, clean, has coffee, and nice bathrooms.\\nHowever, the communication from the workers was non-existent or confusing and driving around the huge complex is a bit overwhelming. It was fairly easy to find the automatic washer, but trying to choose the wash, plus the interior clean, plus pay for it all was extremely complicated and involved the big machine by the automatic washing area, plus a worker with an iPad, and her \"magic card\", plus my credit card, which I then had to swipe again after my car was done being cleaned. Then, when I got out of the automatic washer, there were 5 people wiping my car down, none of which told me where to go to get the interior cleaned, even though it was plainly marked on my window that I wanted the interior cleaning as well. So, I left the washer, drove through the gas station parking lot next door, back out onto Brodie Lane, back into the huge complex for Palms and wandered a bit until I found an area marked Full Service and Detailing. Then I pulled into an empty stall, got out, and just stood there until one of the other workers came up to me asked what I was doing. So that was odd and confusing, but the people were nice and they did a good job in the end.\\nOverall I\\'m very happy with their work and the price so I\\'ll certainly come back regularly, especially now that I know where to go in the maze that is Palms at each step of the car washing process!',\n",

I gave the woman on the phone my email address, phone number, and preferred dates and she promised to email me once she checked her book and found availability.  A week later, not having heard back, I went on their website to book the date on my own. Unfortunately the link was broken so no go! Then I called back to book it on the phone and got voice mail. Left a message. A day later, still no call back! \\n\\nMaybe they are just so busy that losing a new customer is of no concern. Doesn't seem like a sustainable business model to me.\",\n",

Read this entire post to understand this update. \\n\\nI usually do not write reviews for places right away, unless they go above and beyond, and do something great in customer service. \\n\\nOkay folks listen up. I went in to get my tire fixed. I ran over a pretty big nail at some point and had been riding on a spare for a day. I met with the customer service man and he inspected my tire, and all the others, to see what level they\\'re at. I already knew I am going to need new ones, but they had to see if they could even fix it, because once a tire reaches a certain level of tread, they can no longer repair holes. Luckily they did not try to lie and tell me that I needed to get new tires. I was at just the right amount to get it plugged, which is good because I am not ready this month financially to get a new set all around. \\n\\nThey guy I spoke with, which his name seems to escape me now, so please forgive me. I know I should have memorized his name since I am so impressed and all, but I am the worst for names. Anywho, this guy did show me that even with his higher end tire, it would still be cheaper for me to purchase a set there versus the dealership I got my new car from. The lowest end was 50 dollars a tire, and guaranteed for 35,000 miles. That\\'s pretty good. \\n\\nHere\\'s why I will go back. They took my car in and fixed it in under 20 minutes. The guy who did the repair, a different gentleman, came out and informed me he would be pulling it up front for me, nice. Then I turn to the guy who I gave all my info to and asked what the total damage was, and you know what he says. \"You don\\'t owe us anything Chad, it\\'s free tire repair here.\" Yeah he called me by my name, lol. That wasn\\'t what impressed me though. He wants my business, so he just did that for me. I was already going to come back in a month to get new tires, before I trade in my car for a Jeep, because it was a good deal for the set of tires. Now though, they have a customer for life, and that I can guarantee. \\n\\nOh, and one more thing. The rims they have there are so nice and moderately priced too. There was this sick gunmetal black rim I loved, but I don\\'t want to invest in my car I am trading up, that ran for 99 dollars each, and another which was chrome and black for like 109 dollars each.

Yes, it smells, but when don\\'t animals smell when you probably have at least 50 animals and 2 people to clean? Even for that, it doesn\\'t smell that bad- it smells like my rabbit\\'s cage after a few days.

I am a customer who LOATHES to return things, & almost never have had to do it. Once in 15 yrs shopping at Market Basket, once in 15 yrs at Whole Foods, both times because it was a wrong item that I had bought. Incident 1. Early on, I bought some snacks that had gone bad. I called them right away & When I went back there was a little fuss but the young boy who took it back admonished me & said that I should not do it again (so it was my fault!) Incident 2. A 'sweet' famous in my region has recently been made & sold here in the US. I had bought it earlier in NY & it was excellent. SO seeing them in this store, i bought two boxes - upon opening the first, we found it tasted awful & it had a weird after taste. Having had the earlier experience, i was hesitant but did bring it up with a guy at the cash counter. He said they don't take back sweets. It was sealed and frozen but OK, i got rid of it (not cheap). Incident 3 was in two parts, so bear with me - I asked for 6 samosas, (so the same man who had politely told me he would not take back the sweets), packed them & wrote the number 6 on the outside. Upon going home I found 5 samosas....so figured that I must have been mistaken that samosas are a dollar each.....& that 6 must have been the price (which would make it 1.25 each). However I was there on Wednesday this week & saw that the samosas were indeed 1.00 per samosa, so there was a mistake last time. Seeing the same 'friendly' person who had packed them last time, I told him that he had written 6 but I found only 5 inside. SO making a genial point of his generosity/openness - he said to me, Don't worry, I'll give you an extra samosa today, 'neither you nor I are going to benefit from $1.00, (loose translation)'. So he put them in & wrote 6 outside & reiterated that there were SEVEN inside. I came home & as it was tea time, my husband opened up the samosa bag to toast - Imagine our disbelief & feelings to see that he had only packed SIX. There were no 7 in there. \\n\\nI am only a single customer, but I am feel I am a trouble free, good & loyal customer who goes back to the same business for ever. For me, I like the small local store connections & try to build it wherever I live. They just weren't/aren't interested or  ready for a repeat customer like myself.

The ropa vieja was good, although a little too hard. The congris did not have a lot of flavor but I was satisfied anyway. Overall, it was a good place. Close to what I would consider authentic from Miami. I will definitely come back because I am sure this is as authentic as it will ever get in a town with a very very small Cuban population.\",\n",

My husband had ordered the chicken sandwich and I ordered the hot chicken plate. He also ordered the fries with no pickle. After we had sat down they brought my husband the fries and said he could have them on the house because they accidentally put pickle but they would be bringing out a new order without the pickle. In my opinion that was a very good move however the new backs they brought out had a hair in it and we ended up not eating it nor did we bother to bring it to the front. Why? Because by this time we had also received our main meals and those were so unsatisfactory is that we had some get up as not a good food place so no point to ask for new ones. My chicken plate was nothing but mush. The chicken was so thin or had been pounded so much that it had tears in the middle so really it was only a mangled piece of chicken covered in so much breading and sauce that it tasted like mushy meat when eating it. My husband's chicken sandwich suffered the same but also lacked an incredible amount of flavor. It was so Bland!\\n\\nI expected so much more from this place because of the reviews, however when we were there we could tell a lot of people had ordered the tofu sandwich.

I know this is bad and naughty. I do keep my dog under control and as a canine good citizen and wildlife conservation dog, she is very well trained. \\n\\nThat said, I have a big concern. The last time I was in the park, a park employee or volunteer was out spraying herbicides on the blackberries to get rid of them. They told me my dog should be on leash because, 1.) them's the rules and 2.) the herbicide can cause serious eye damage to animals that come in contact with it. As long as we stay on the trail, it should be fine, they told me. This concerned me greatly because, of course, I don't want my dog near any kind of herbicide that can make it go blind and more importantly, no one gave that memo to the wild birds, rodents and mammals that live in the park. Such a bummer! I'd happily thrown in extra time to help eradicate blackberries manually or contribute to a fund that would employ workers to tear out the blackberries in a way that doesn't involve dangerous poison. \\n\\nAnyway.

       " 'I am known for being overly wordy.... so let me say at the start that I am stressed out about keeping this review brief!  There are just too many amazing things to share about WCA.  During the holidays I wanted to bring in a thank you gift but was unsure how to proceed... I\\'m not into baking... a card?  Needles?  What could express my gratitude?  Well, I got distracted so here I am writing a review to say thank you and save face.\\n\\nSpeaking of saving face... WCA actually SAVED MY FACE!!!!  I woke up with Bell\\'s Palsy November 17th and made it into WCA four days later after a recommendation from a friend.  Bell\\'s Palsy is a strange inflammation of the facial nerve where half your face becomes paralyzed.  Most people take about four months to recover from what I researched, but many people do not recover or only partially recover.  I could deal with looking \"different\" but the discomfort was really hard to ignore.  I wanted to get better.\\n\\nNot having health insurance that covered acupuncture at the time, I was unsure how to proceed.  Most acupuncturists charge a minimum of $75 a visit in my experience.  This is a lot to take on for an acute condition that requires repeat visits.  I\\'d driven by WCA many times, as it is in my neighborhood, so I decided to stop in and see if it was \"for real.\"  How could they charge a sliding scale of $15-$35 and stay in business?  The short answer is that unlike most Western acupuncture offices, WCA practices the community acupuncture model (which they developed).  Community acupuncture more closely resembles what you might find in places where acupuncture is more traditionally practiced.  There is a room with recliner chairs and blankets where many patients are seen at once.  In this way, the acupuncturist can see more patients in one day than a typical Western practitioner and the patients can gather in what becomes a true place of healing.  Business is better for acupuncturists in community acupuncture and patients get access to affordable health care.  Check out the documentary made about WCA and the growing co-op of community acupuncture clinics: http://workingclassacupuncture.org/?id=7\\n\\nAt this point you may have left the review... but I warned you I get wordy...!  Okay so I went to WCA for the first time and met Adrian, an acupuncturist beyond enthusiastic about her work.  She was so positive and caring and gave me a lot of hope.  She said I should try to come in as often as possible at the beginning -at least seven of the next ten days.  So, I did.  I went into WCA as my schedule permitted and stayed for an hour each time.  I was not particular about which acupuncturists I saw, as I knew each one would have his or her own style and method of treatment.  I appreciated each and every acupuncturist who helped me and felt their individual gifts as healers.  Some are deliberate and take their time, but most are lightning fast.  Before you know it, you have tons of needles working their magic all over.  Sometimes I\\'d wonder.. when did she even put that needle in?! All the acupuncturists offer you blankets and check on you often.  It\\'s extremely comforting, relaxing, and restful.  \\n\\nThe interior of WCA Cully has reminded me of a womb from the first day.  The ceiling, walls, chairs, etc., all look soft and comforting.  This might seem weird but I really think it taps into a nurturing that is very basic and relatable.  The acupuncture\\'s efficacy is a mystery and this swaddled up atmosphere fits right in.  There is also just a wonderful and powerful communal sense of healing here.  So many people coming in to take care of themselves and be healthy.  \\n\\nWCA is relaxing, welcoming, comforting, but does it actually work?  YES.  My face began improving from the first visit!  I could feel immediate improvements!  Besides that, it just gave me such relief from the discomfort and pain involved with the Bell\\'s Palsy.  I felt very cared for each and every time I visited and the acupuncturists were always congratulating me on the improvements in healing.  I feel very vulnerable when I sit down and begin talking to each acupuncturist.  It\\'s not always easy to share what worries or troubles you. Some people are scared of the needles.  I recommend everyone give it a try if you are curious.  The acupuncturists will go at your speed and make sure you are always comfortable.  \\n\\nWCA wants everyone to feel empowered to take charge of their own health and have access to affordable care.  I am so appreciative and have recommended countless people visit.  It took me about 45 days to achieve almost full recovery of my facial paralysis.  This is SO fast compared to what I\\'ve seen and heard from others!!!  I am so appreciative and now 3 months later and with my face 99.9% functional, I find myself back at WCA for help with other issues.  Maybe I just like resting in the womb in a recliner with blankets.  But really, I know WCA is my best option for healthcare.  And how lucky am I to have them close by!',\n",

I actually think because it wasn't drowned in spices, you can actually taste the flavor of the crawfish.  \\n\\nMixed Crab Bowl: 2lb snow crab, 1 lb dungeness crab clusters, and 1 lb king crab legs w/ drawn butter.  (all weights are prior to cooking) $84.00.  This was definitely a splurge. I was a bit hesitant because 4 lbs of crab isn't necessarily a lot and restaurants usually overcharge.  I was pleasantly surprised when the crab that came out was practically all meat.  The crabs were cooked just right, the meat was juicy and warm, and the overall digging in with our bare hands and riping up the crab was just right down our alley.  It took us a bit of time to devoure this feast so by the end legs were starting to get a bit cold.  It was still overpriced, but if I had another celebration to attend at this restaurant I would not hesitate to order this dish again with someone.  \\n\\nI've been there where they have offered us a great catch, a 20lb lobster or whatever giant monstrosity they happen to catch that day.

After dinner we ordered desert and tea, while waiting for the desert a waitress told us to leave if we weren't ordering anything else (not knowing we had actually ordered desert). Completely rude and uncalled for specially because we had made reservations a week prior. They lack the skills to run a restaurant and were not prepared for more customers. Very disappointing, will most likely not return. At the end, we went to pay the bill, they had already added 15percent tip to the bill even though the service was extremely bad and they were trying to make us leave quickly so they can give the table to someone else.

We chose the Peabody due to its close proximity to the convention center (the most convenient location) and stayed here from a Sat to a Fri. We arrived extremely early on Saturday and luckily they had an available room for us. I wasn't a fan of the smaller room (and I'd be the one hanging out in it the most) so we upgraded a notch and got a larger room in the Mallard Tower. It was very spacious with a separate seating area and a vanity for me! Yes, the Mallard Tower is the older building, but when we looked to switch to the newer tower due to our a/c not working so well, I didn't like the size/layout of the room. We decided our current room was better. We had another minor glitch in that our fridge was not working, but that was fixed by giving us another working fridge in the room.\\n\\nShould I need to return to Orlando to be near the convention center, I would stay here again. The convenience factor is huge, but the service is what sold me. It was impeccable. Every single person is incredibly accommodating and nice! Really made our hotel stay and minor blips easy to get over. Although I wish the rooms had coffee makers. Another plus are those like me who do not have children. Luckily, there are two pools. The grotto pool is the huge one w/ the waterfall close to the parking structure. The quieter lap pool is also large and catered more towards adults. I loved this area. While the husband was in his classes, I was relaxing by the pool. More hotels need two pool areas like the Peabody. I also got to check out the lovely fitness center (didn't use it), and used the spa twice. Wish the spa was larger with a hot sauna as well as the steam sauna.\\n\\nPeabody also has a few restaurants. I recommend Napa for lunch and dinners. B-Line Grill was gross and Capriccio not very good either. I also recommend self-park. I'm normally a valet girl b/c I'm lazy, but every time we valeted, it was backed up and took forever for our car to come out. The parking structure is conveniently located a short walk from the hotel. It was faster and a bit cheaper to park this way.\",\n",

I immediately put my fork down and waited for a waiter. He was new so his trainer deeply scrutinized the plate in front of us, not believing. He was liked away where it was sunny and looked through the humus again, then again. I was appalled that he had to comb through the dish so many times, when he cold have simply apologized and brought a new one. After 5 mins, the manager came to speak to us with all sorts of excuses. He started by saying that he berated all his staff in the kitchen, mentioned that no one in the it hen has long hair and that the brush they used to use would shed. He went on to elaborate that when a costumer found hair in the past, it was just brush hair and the costumer was being \"extra\". I didn\\'t like the demeaning nature of this manager.

Once we got our drinks, the bartender walked around to the outside of the bar and sat down, not getting up the whole time to check and see if we needed anything, etc. I had to signal her over from across the bar to ask for our check.

I'll start by saying how cool it is that you can order off of Teela's menu, or from their neighboring sister restaurant, Tin Can Fish House and Oyster Bar.\\n\\nI opened with the calamari, which was crappy.  It was only half breaded, undercooked, and kind of soggy.  The squid was served on cheap plastic trays (are we in a food court or something?) and both tartar sauce and cocktail sauce tasted like they came out of a can.  It's not hard to make either of those in house, I do at my own restaurant.  \\n\\nA note on service: the calamari came out a good 20 minutes after I ordered it (usually takes 90 seconds in the fryer) but my tacos were prepared in a matter of minutes.  That's not a good way to stagger a multi-course  meal, especially with only a dozen customers present.\\n\\nThe tacos were another story.  I had the Pork Carnitas with Corn and Pepper Pico de Gallo, Onions, and Cilantro.  The meat was tender and juicy, but a little too fatty.  The tacos are loaded, and the corn pico/onions/cilantro was a killer topping.  My next taco was amazing: Chorizo Stuffed Dates with Bacon Bits and Feta.  The sausage was authentic and mildly spicy, which balanced out the sweet fruitiness of the dates.  And bacon bits?  Ahem, more like bacon STRIPS.  Like 6 of them.  Crispy, meaty goodness.  There was a huge amount of feta, too much actually, but I just pulled some off.\\n\\nUnfortunately, a week later my friend brought me a Chorizo taco that was decent at best.  The proportion of meat and toppings was way off, my bacon strips turned into bits, and something just tasted wrong.  I also had their Brisket taco, whose meat was tender and tasty but the toppings/condiments didn't add up.  \\n\\nYes, I'll be back to try more tacos, maybe some beers after work.

The guy I had twice before was so negligent that I got his name from my check and memorized it so that when I returned I\\'d ask that they seat me anywhere but his area.\\n\\nI came in today and asked for a one person booth for one and she says they don\\'t have any so they had to seat me in the back where all the tables are.  Ok, no real problem, but I was there alone, and it wasn\\'t peak hours just yet; it was obvious that I just wanted to eat and enjoy a meal with minimal disturbance or distraction.  And yet, she tried to seat me DIRECTLY next to another person at a table, even though the whole space where the tables were was empty.  I said no, I\\'d like to sit over there please (referring to a small table on the other side) and she obliged.  It just seemed like common sense and common courtesy to me.  Even in mall foodcourts, total strangers don\\'t sit directly next to one another, let alone at an uncrowded sit-down restaurant.  \\n\\nThen, maybe 10 minutes later, they came back and seated a party of two DIRECTLY next to me.  It was extremely awkward because the rest of the area was just about empty and fairly quiet, and they were so close to me.  I was irritated; she easily could have sat them at any other of the 5 empty tables and the waitress assigned to that area wouldn\\'t have been inconvenienced.  I was going to try to tough it out, but the woman at the table turned out to be particularly loud, borderline obnoxious in my opinion.  I put on my headphones (not earbuds, but headphones) to drown her out, even though I\\'d intended specifically to come there to read while I ate dinner.  Could still hear her loud and clear.  I tactfully asked the waitress if they had a table available up front, and she responds, \"no, they\\'re all taken.  I can serve you here\" pointing to the table 4 inches to my right.  I responded \"No, that would be the same thing\", trying to maintain my tone of voice.  And though my request to be moved was clearly code for \"get me out of here please! NOW.\", she wouldn\\'t oblige.  They lied.  There were tables available.  I discovered this when, only moments after they brought out my order, I quickly gathered all of my uneaten food and was walking out to leave with it.  They just didn\\'t want to move me because of the inconvenience of either having to switch me to another waiter, or her having to serve me outside of her table area. \\n\\nMy whole issue really is that they don\\'t seem customer service centered and reading some of the other reviews, they don\\'t make common sense decisions with their customers.  3 distinct times I\\'ve walked out of there in a huff because of the treatment.  I also agree with some of the other reviewers, they tend to take a little too long, even when it\\'s not crowded.  I wouldn\\'t recommend this location at all just because the service is too much of a gamble, you never know what you\\'re gonna get.  To be fair, the food is consistent and I have had some really good waiters here and there, but again, it\\'s too much of a gamble.',\n",

The menu sounds great with trendy options that would compete downtown. Unfortunately, what is delivered to the table falls a little short.

Sweet caesar salad? Sweetened bell peppers with hangar steak? Even sweet fingerling potatoes. It is not overwhelming by any means but just enough to leave my taste buds confused and off-balance.\\n\\nWith that said, the views and ambiance really are fantastic!

       " \"I love this place. I just started taking guitar lessons from Alex a few weeks ago after taking lessons with a previous instructor for about a month and a half. The reason I quit my lessons with my previous instructor was because the lessons consisted mostly of him just teaching me new chords and having me play the chords/various simple songs over and over at increasing speeds. I felt like I could've learned all of that on my own, and I felt totally uninspired after each lesson.\\n\\nWith Alex, it's a whole different story. In our very first lesson, he emphasized to me the importance of learning the fretboard not just by memorizing different chord shapes, but also by understanding both conceptually and instinctively how each string is laid out and exactly what notes you're playing at all times (as well as which notes make up the chords you play, why they create the sound they do, etc.). He talked about how a lot of people will learn to play the guitar by learning a bunch of chord shapes, but then when asked to improvise or make their own song will only be able to play through the chords that they've memorized by rote. By learning the fretboard by heart, we can instead hear a tune or a certain sound in our head and play it immediately, rather than relying on muscle memory for all of our music-making. He gave me an EXTREMELY useful exercise for kicking off this process.\\n\\nEvery single lesson with him is a great learning experience. The classes are loosely structured and he tends to ask me what I want to work on before each class. No matter what it is that I show him, he always gives me incredibly useful advice to make my playing sound smoother, add a little extra flair, etc. He's not the kind of instructor who just listens to me play, tells me it sounds fine, and moves on without offering anything useful.\\n\\nOn top of all of that, Alex is honestly just an incredibly likable and positive guy. He's really fun to take lessons from and he's also really really good at guitar. Unlike my previous instructor, he doesn't hesitate at all to demonstrate things when I ask him to. He can pretty much hear any guitar song and play it instantly, often adding his own personal touch to it (well, he's been able to for the songs I've showed him thus far). He has a huge knowledge base and has learned tons of cool tricks from all of his years in music. I've left each lesson so far knowing I've learned something valuable and feeling really happy and inspired.\",\n",
       " \"Weekday lunch times are surprisingly quiet at NBC Sports Grill & Brew, at least in the two times that I've been here. They have two floors of seating, but the upstairs don't seem to be open for lunch. The food is pretty typical American fare. They try to make it a little more interesting with fusions of other cuisines, but in the end, it's all pretty standard.\\n\\nMy first meal here was the Bang-Bang Chicken. It was decent, but they doused the entire plate with overly toasted coconut shavings. I had to try to pick them out because even if you love coconuts, this was overwhelming. If you order this dish, be sure to ask for the coconuts to be on the side. My second meal here was one of the flatbreads. It was very average - not terrible, but not the greatest either.\\n\\nThey have a decent beer selection, and even one (or more?) that is specially brewed for them. For folks who are into craft beer, you will have some options, but probably not the most ideal if you're in the snobbier side of the craft beer spectrum. They also tend to be overpriced, but typical for its location.\\n\\nOverall, not my first choice when it comes to the options at CityWalk, but not too bad either, especially if you're looking for standard American food while watching sports.\",\n",

Like as if it it was stewed a little too long, burned on the bottom and therefore permeated that burnt taste throughout. We told our server about it who stated that a few others had also complained about it. I happened to also order a fried chicken taco that was also served with queso...that also tasted burnt. In the end, I was impressed by how the manager and server approached the situation. We received a complimentary round of drinks which is the reason and multiple apologies.

The noodle consistency is great and the broth is lava hot.

       " 'This place gets \"nice neighborhood restaurant\" just right, and has one of the top two or three shrimp and grits dishes I\\'ve had in Atlanta.  The warm, laid-back-but-elegant interior combines with a usually very gregarious crowd to form an easy to like environment.  \\n\\nThe menu is more free-spirited and personal compared to a typical southern themed New American style restaurant, a bit playful, like Ron is talking about stuff he salivates over through his menu.  There is a propensity towards putting stuff in a bowl with tasty, gooey sauce/gravy/broth which really reminds me of the sort of shit gluttons think up when having the 2AM munchies.  It helps that sauces are very good at Rosebud otherwise some might find the approach sloppy.  Asian flavors are also lovingly referenced in a few places, with enough restraint and good taste to not come off as ill-advised fusion experiments; though don\\'t interest me much.  \\n\\nI\\'ve had dinner here about four times and brunch once.  Appetizers are mostly solid with fried oysters and bruschetta being standouts but calamari and mussels underwhelming.  A crab cake special had some of the best crabby flavors I\\'ve had but is not on the regular menu.  The best entree is shrimp and grits, rightfully mentioned as a great dish in this area by many people.  This version is a sweeter take on cajun style with a generous amount of delicious tomato gravy.  Grit is cooked just right.  It\\'s usually a struggle to try new entrees because resist ordering this dish is so difficult.  Out of the seven entrees ordered by my party in last two visits, four were the shrimp and grits.  Surprisingly juicy is the braised lamb shank.  Decent fish (I\\'ve sampled the trout), generally good vegetable sides.  On the other hand, disappointing is the fried chicken--bland, although only slightly worse than the norm for $15 fancy fried chickens, of which I\\'ve tried many.  Another bad entree was a pork rib special, presumably smoked using the BGE outside, that turned out unpleasantly dry and we were hardly able to finish.  Brunch can be a great time to give Rosebud a first try, as it\\'s more casual, features many grit dishes, and still has many normal items available, including the shrimp and grit.  \\n\\nThe beverage selection doesn\\'t dazzle but the whole package keeps up with the times competently, with good mixed drinks, enough respectable beers (not a lot), and many wines by the glass as well as the option to go with house wine for simplicity and economy.  \\n\\nService is excellent and I have no problem with the fact that the chef writes a blog venting about bad customers.

       " \"Pijiu belly is new restaurant in Westside that had its soft opening last Tuesday(12/09/2014). They call themselves a pub fare restaurant with Asian influence. I had a chance to try their food for lunch. Pijiu means beer - I am not sure they named the restaurant beer belly or the belly is a reference to pork belly in their menu. Regardless, it's always nice to see new restaurants. \\n\\nThe restaurant is located on left, if you are driving from GA tech campus and 85, on 10th street, past north avenue and right across the street from sherwin Williams store. The parking is in a lot, right next to the restaurant. Currently it's a self park, but I hear it's going to valet parking in the future. The lot will fill up to 18 cars but they also have another lot up the street. \\n\\nWhen you enter you will see the prominent bar with granite counter, bar stools and TVs. On the left there is small area for dart boards and pool tables(not complete yet but I was told that the plan). There are several high bar tables on the right side area with 6 seating each and regular tables with 4 seating in the back, behind the bar. It has a modern-industrial style. \\n\\nThe menu is rather simple for now - but they will have a revised menu with more items during their grand opening in January. It has charcuterie plates, starters, burgers and sandwiches, sides and beverages. And of course they have beer menu on the board as well. Taking about beer, they don't have beer on tap installed yet but I was told that it will be ready by end of the week with large selections. \\n\\nFrom charcuterie selection, I ordered la cabana - soft goat milk cheese made in Spain with rosemary crust. I liked the cheese but it wasn't as soft as I expected it to be. I also ordered, spicy soppressata - Italian made spicy pork cured meat and it was delicious. The plate was served with strawberry jam, pineapple chutney, Dijon mustard and balsamic reduction.($4 each and $11 for three). \\n\\nI also ordered, 'The Pijiu burger' based on recommendation from the bartender. It had fried egg, kimchi, cheese, beer-bbq sauce on brioche bread and served with hand-cut fries, onion, tomato and pickles. ($13) \\n\\nThe burger had complex flavors and tasty, thanks to the runny egg yolk, kimchi, onion and beer-bbq sauce. It all works well together. My only gripe is that kimchi was quite oversalted for my taste and it kind of takes away the experience a bit. I liked it overall but would have loved it if they had salted kimchi just right. Strangely, there was no salt at all in the pickles and it was spicy!! I mean, I am ok with that but some of my friends who are hardcore pickle lovers would have problem with no salt pickles. \\n\\nThe hand-cut fries was perfect though - neither too thin, nor thick. So it was nice and crunchy outside and moist inside. \\n\\nOverall, I like what I see. Yes, they are still setting things up. Currently there is lot of empty spaces, beer on tap missing and so on. But that's what the soft opening is for - to get feedbacks and make sure everything right before grand opening.\",\n",
       " 'After reading the reviews I have given this shop a try and after one visit I will not return. I have been a VW enthusiast for over 20 years, so after moving from California and having a lot of options of independent mechanics I thought Full Throttle was the perfect transition after moving to Orlando. What I found was a shop that failed to do simple work and give me bad advice. I took my Passat in there for a brake job, simple rotor and pad replacement, when I asked the service tech I can\\'t recall his name but he\\'s the only guy answering phones and giving \"advice\", told me when I break in the new pads/rotors I should accelerate as fast as I can like up to 60 mph and brake as hard as I can. Anyone who has common knowledge/sense of brakes knows this is the opposite of what you\\'re suppose to do, I just acted like he was right, as I knew it was a bad sign, he also proceeded to give somewhat of a guilt trip for bringing in my own parts. The other thing they did was flush my transmission fluid, oddly, he said it was low when they checked it and said I should bring the car back in a week or two to recheck the fluid level. As soon as I got the car back the transmission started to jerk, which had never done before. Having owned this car for 8 years I knew they had either messed something up or did not put back enough AT fluid, which is why he said come back? I took it to another mechanic I trust but is further from my house, he checked the AT fluid level and said it was 2 quarts low, which was causing the jerking during gear shifts. He filled up the missing fluid and the problem was gone. I will never go back to Full Throttle. I can see how people would be fooled to think these guys are VW lovers and treat people who drive dubs with some type of special treatment or loyalty, and that may be the case for some, but for me, based on talking and going to many shops over two decades, these guys are just full of themselves and want to act like they are the only alternative when it comes to working on dubs. I am disappointed because I was hoping I could find a VW shop I trust, but all I got was weird attitude, bad workmanship, and bad advice. I am writing this review because I think most of the reviews on here are written by shop friends in order to drum business. And I want to give an objective review of a bad experience that i think was not an aberration, but rather more the norm. Lastly, when I brought the car to my other VW mechanic who is now worth going out of my way to see. He found a coolant leak at the rear flange where it was completely rotted away. He couldn\\'t figure out how the guys at Full Throttle missed it, because FT also replaced a leaking valve cover gasket, so he told me they should have seen the leaking coolant.  That\\'s it, rant done.',\n",

The toppings range from your usual suspects, to really unique but delicious! You can also order your burger green, meaning it comes wedged between two big slabs of iceburg lettuce - AWESOME for those of us curbing carbs. But that being said, the buns are made in house and must be tried at least once! Burgers range from $9 to $14, just for the burger. Fries come at $3 - but its a whole basket that can feed 2 to 4 people easily. \\nConsidering its free-range, healthy meat - the price is unbeatable!\\n\\nfinally, dessert! DONUTS made FRESH with different dips. OH MY. sooooooo good. \\n\\nAll around, Romer's ROCKS. Its great whether you are watching a game, or out for a date.

The baked chicken is perfectly done, juicy, and covered with coarsely ground spices.  The pot roast is tender, flavorful and rich.  Delicious. \\n\\nSurprisingly the steak isn't bad, either.  You can get grilled sirloin every night, cooked to order.  Clearly the meat is injected for tenderness and flavor, but it always comes out hot and fresh with consistent texture.  I've had worse tasting and tougher at expensive steak places. \\n\\nAnother surprising item is the freshly sauteed green beans which are available only some of the time, with sauteed onions and whole strips of bacon. When those are gone, the cooks open a can of regular green beans that are unseasoned and boiled.  Not so good.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is what you'd expect for a food trough, compete with human visual appetite suppressants waddling around you.

I decided on going to Bosphorous as our anniversary dinner restaurant, over Texas De Brazil while we were driving to Orlando from Ponce Inlet (1.5hr away, no ethnic, fine-dining restaurants here up to par).. Bosphorous was actually second on my list. They have a great website with a full menu (and good music to boot!).\\n\\nThe atmosphere was very elegant (as most Winter Park restaurants) and quite lonely on a Monday night (as most ethnic restaurants are in this area). We started our appetizers with the Turkish Ezme, which my husband nearly inhaled. It was described to us as Turkish salsa, and it was superb! So fresh! I am definitely looking that recipe up online. One thing to mention, you have to order the Lavas (Turkish large hollow bread) to eat with it. My opinon, have the bread come with the appetizer on the menu, versus ala carte. The bread was to die for, topped with melted butter and crisp sesame seeds. I barely got a handful of pieces, as my husband was wolfing that down, too!\\n\\nI loved the Turkish wine there, the winery brand is Yakut. Delicious, especially if you love a smooth, well-spiced but mellow red wine. After studying the menu, I decided to order the Yogurt Sis Kebap with rice instead of the buttered bread. My husband ordered the Turkish Pizza, him being a Pizza guy and all-around American that is just venturing into international cuisines. \\n\\nThe owner then came by our table and introduced himself. Then, he explained what type of dishes he enjoys and mentioned that the kitchen is all Turkish cooks. I was so excited. He even improvised our food order to make it extra special, and my lamb more crispy on the outside. That was unexpected and that service sets the bar above average! He then elaborated on the origins of the wine and let us enjoy our dinner as it was then served.\\n\\nI cannot describe how delicious the meal was. I moved here from Dallas, and all throughout Texas we have several Turkish restaurants, as well as so many other ethnicities. This was truly the best Turkish food I've had in my life and I am a Spaniard. \\n\\nWe finished the night off with a delicious cup of Turkish coffee, served the proper way on a Turkish serving tray! Our server was lovely and provided great suggestions. You really must try this restaurant and if you like intimacy, don't go on a weekend. It was awesome.\",\n",

I was SO IMPRESSED with how the staff here treated us--I told the receptionist before we came in about her somewhat peculiar needs and they were more than accommodating. They made sure that only female members of the staff handled her and they made sure that she didn't interact with other animals, allowing us to wait in a separate room rather than the waiting room and shifting some things around in their treatment area so that she wouldn't have to be bandaged up near other pups. \\n\\nEveryone we interacted with was totally comfortable with her breed and her demeanor (they were incredibly understanding of her dog-aggression and there was absolutely no judgement of her as a bad dog or of me as a bad owner, which we've experienced with other places) and I would strongly recommend this place to other pit bull parents. \\n\\nI was really impressed with Dr. scwartzman--she was very gentle with my girl and did a wonderful job building a little bit of a relationship with her in the short time of our appointment, and she also took the time to explain the injury and treatment thoroughly to me and made sure to answer all of my questions.  \\n\\nThe vet techs were awesome as well--they gave my pup plenty of treats to help her feel more comfortable (they even used a frozen container of baby food to distract her, which I think is brilliant) and they did an excellent job with the bandages themselves. \\n\\nFinally, the front desk staff was spectacular--they were super nice and super helpful and they obviously care about the people and pets they get to interact with. \\n\\nI felt that the pricing here was very fair--I'm surprised to see so many other reviewers complaining about the cost. Also, for me, the fact that they required an exam before treating her injuries was a huge plus--I wouldn't feel comfortable having a vet prescribe treatment or medication without first examining my dog, and at least to me, it seems far less a scam to get money out of unsuspecting owners and far more a hallmark of a responsible and well run medical practice.\",\n",

We went on OX. \\nCritique one, get a good guide for the trucks,  The jungle cruise at Dw is scripted fun.  This is not. bits of interesting stuff,(like dw pays them to take waste from animal kingdom) but not enough. \\nCritique two, spend some upkeep money on the trucks.  They were quick to tell us each truck cost 100 k. What have they done since? Idea would be fix  the seats, (all were falling apart) add a speaker system for the driver, and maybe add a few fans for days its hot as the sun like it was this past Wednesday. Given it was a full tour, this could be done!\\nCritique 3, when its this hot, why have the kids take turns driving the truck. Its cute but likely not the brightest thing to do anyway. \\nPart two in the store:\\nfriendly with samples, nice stuff to look at but my final critique is to clean up the place during the day.  We did try the Orange slushy and frozen berry lemonade.  Both were very good.  But when we sat outside to finish them, wrappers and cups were everywhere.\\n\\nThe slushy and the kids liking the trucks save a one star rating.  This could be a perennial 4 with an occasional 5 star as a repeat visit place  with some attention to detail.  I usually take a lot of pictures but did not post with this review.  That will keep this a half full review.\",\n",

Only waited about 15 minutes and the food was brought out on a metal tray. BTW, they have Stevia and Sugar in the Raw for sweeteners. A-plus. The Burger (a Classic, )was good. Fries were over cooked.

The prices were so reasonable, we came during happy hour though, so that helped. I had the Mac n cheese of the day and a quesadilla (all off the happy hour menu, but you'd never guess flavor wise).

       " \"Not a fan. My husband and I went today for lunch, only 2 other tables occupied. I was really looking forward to eating here after reading all the great reviews on Yelp. So, while we were eating I wondered if we just got the wrong dishes since our experience was so different than the reviews on here. \\n\\nFirst I wanted guacamole, but no way was I going to pay $9 for it. So we passed. The online menu shows it is $3.50, but on the menu we only saw it for either $9 (or $10 if you wanted it made at your table). I did not see the offering for $3.50 on the menu. The menu they show online is not the same one we got in the restaurant. \\n\\nI had the enchiladas supreme, $9.75. It is 4 tiny enchiladas (one each of beef, chicken, bean and cheese), with a large pile of lettuce with a few tomatoes and a dollop of guacamole and a dollop of sour cream on top of them; this topping makes it look like a lot of food, when in reality it is not; no rice or beans come with this dish. I am very grateful that I asked for the mole sauce on the side as I did not like it at all. \\n\\nThe beef enchilada had beef with the consistency and taste of the beef from Taco Bell, only edible if you are starving. I have no idea what was up with the cheese enchilada, but whatever it was it didn't even look edible. It was a solid glob of yuck. The chicken enchilada and the bean enchilada were both okay, but nothing special. \\n\\nMy husband had the Enchiladas Verdes, two chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. Again, the chicken enchiladas were okay. His enchiladas were also piled high with lettuce and the tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream making it look like more food than there actually was. His rice was not good and the beans were okay.\\n\\nThe free chips were okay, but thicker than I like. One of the salsas that came with the chips was pretty good, the other not so much, it had a bar-b-que taste to it. \\n\\nOur food came out in less than 5 minutes after we ordered it, which, to me, is an indication that it was not freshly made. More than likely it was already prepared, slapped on a plate and then microwaved for a couple of minutes. In hindsight, my husband thought the frozen chicken enchiladas from Amy's are better than the ones he had here. \\n\\nService was mediocre seeing how there was only 3 tables occupied. The guy was nice, chips and salsa arrive at the table practically before your tail hits the chair, which is great. The water took a long time to come and the check took a long time. After that our waiter disappeared and we ended up taking the check to some workers sitting at another table to ask to pay.\\n\\nThe food at Taqueria Del Sol and Bone Garden is much more to our liking and a lot different than the food at this place. So, maybe it is just not the style of Mexican food we like. \\n\\nWe will not be back.\",\n",

There are just some days where a full size is too much, but the smaller size (500mL at $3.50) was very reasonable, and still more than enough to get your fix. I'm a bubble tea purist at heart so I ordered the milk tea with pearls, half sweet. I loved it. The bubbles were soft and chewy, the perfect consistency. The milk tea was also nice and refreshing, and tasted like actual black tea rather than the powdery milk tea drinks I'm usually accustomed to. Although I had ordered it half sweet, it still had the perfect amount of sweetness to it.

The burgers were exceptional and I liked the fact that they were not too big (5.5 oz), because when I left I didn't feel like throwing up or taking a diabetic nap like I do when I eat at George's or the Vortex. \\n\\nWe actually had enough energy to head over to IKEA and pickup some picture frames. Speaking of IKEA, the join totally looks like it was furnished by the Swedish furniture giant. The white walls and modern red plastic chairs look like something from A Clockwork Orange. \\n\\nWe split the Nutella and burnt marshmellow shake, it was O.K, nothing to slap family members about.\\n\\nOverall the experience and burgers were good and we will certainly head back over to Howell Mill Rd to eat there again.\",\n",

In fact,  I'm going to go out on a limb and say I definitely now prefer Ramen with chicken base over the regular pork base.\\n\\nI was a tad thrown by the whole brown egg that came in the dish and at first thought it was still in the shell but it wasn't.  Biting into it and getting the partially soft yolk was a sublime moment. \\n\\nI am normally quite a big eater and found the regular portion size ample.  I left feeling pleasantly replete and not over full or bloated which would have made continuing my chores onmy bike very uncomfortable.  \\n\\nThe decor is beautiful in an understated way.

The tasting bar is too small for the selection they have, and the pens for tasting are also of poorer quality than other places i went making it really difficult to really get a sense of what i was purchasing. \\n\\nAlso of concern is their liquids for tasting have nicotine, but no labels of which flavors have the nicotine in them and at what level, so you have no idea what level youre at when trying unless you ask an employee who has to recall from memory. I think its important for newbies to be aware of how the nicotone affects the juice/throat hit but i think its more important that consumers know ahead of time what they are trying.\\n\\nI did settle on two flavors,  as i like to have a variety. One i have yet to bust into, but the other, a peanut butter  banana one that i was sooo excited to have found but was waaaay more intense when i put it in my emow at home than when i had it in the store- and not in a good way.

I literally disposed of the rest of the bottle because the thought of it now makes me physically ill.\\n\\nThe prices arent readily listed out which i find awkward and they were out of one flavor i really had wanted/out of various nicotine levels in other flavors.

Still, I wanted it fixed so made an appointment with a new company. And I tried calling peace frog back to tell them when the appointment with the new cleaner was, but they conveniently did not answer or return my calls.\\n\\nThen, the owner showed up at my house with a refund check without any warning or prior notice. I was alone with two small kids asleep in the house and having this angry guy just appear at my door (He was also upset also about my yelp review) was startling. He seemed to think the refund, while genuinely appreciated, would finish things, but they don\\'t just advertise a refund, they say 200%, and my carpet was still stinking, so I told him when my appointment with the new cleaner was. While standing on my doorstep, he refused to come in and look at (or more importantly smell) the damaged carpet just a few feet away. \\n\\nWhen I asked if he would pay for someone else to fix it, as the office manager suggested, he told me no, adding that if I had a problem with that answer, I could write about it on Yelp.

My main objections to the ribs and wings were that they were very salty without being terribly savory. I think that this place could be even better if the owners tweaked parts of the menu.\",\n",

There were hardly any vegan options which I found somewhat baffling since this restaurant is located in a very progressive area where many educated  and  health conscious individuals live.

Staff is friendly but in a very robotic and scripted manner.\\n\\nAfter reading the owner's reply to my comment, I felt I needed to reply. I appreciate the courteous response. I do not agree that 1/500 customers are vegan. That statistic is misguided. What source are you getting your information? Secondly , I was invited to your restaurant for dinner and had no choice.  Having said that I feel your establishment just was not the right fit for me . Thank you for being honest and best of luck.\",\n",

The cashier was efficient though not very courteous.  I ordered the Classic 1/3 pound Thick Burger (which similar to McDonalds' 1/3 pounder is also made of Angus beef), small fries and a small drink.  I got a plastic number tag to place on my table.  \\nThe washroom was not very dirty or stinky but it could have used a flush and a scrub.  My food arrived at my table after less than 5 minutes (it's nice that you don't have to wait by the cashier for your name or number to be called), but without my drink, so I had to go and get a cup from the cashier.  The tray was clean but it had a bump which made it wobbly. It was also a bit too small.  \\nThe hamburger was in a paper wrapper inside a thick paper box.  The order of fries was of decent size even though it's called 'small'.  Each table has a napkin dispenser which is convenient.  \\nThe burger was good size, fresh veggies and just a little bit too much sauce.  The patty was not too greasy although it could use a small boost of extra flavour or maybe some pickle slices.  The fries were nice, crispy outside and moist inside, and not too salty.  All in all  satisfying meal.  \\nThe place looks like a typical fast food restaurant but it has a special plaque to commemorate its founder.  \\nI did not see tables with dirty trays on them left uncleared.  \\nThere is a long bar-like table at the street level floor plus tables for 2 and 4 people.  At the other floor there is another long table, tables for 2 people and 4 booth tables. \\nThe front door is a bit heavy and difficult to open, and to get to the cashier you have to climb about 6-7 stairs.

They have a great selection of premium jeans as well as a lot of other \"teenager/young adult premium wear\" and accessories. If you wear a standard size pant (waist size 28-40), this is a fantastic place to shop for jeans, as they carry a range of washes, fits, lengths, etc.. so you\\'ll be able to find a few pairs that fit well and look great.\\n\\nThe quality of clothing is premium, but it\\'s not crazy expensive either. I\\'ve had jeans from there last through beatings; only 1 pair has gotten a hole in it, and not a single torn seam. Most jeans are going to cost $70-80, but there will be a few that may cost more. They\\'re definitely a good value if you\\'re looking for a premium quality clothing product without spending a fortune. \\n\\nAlthough their clothes are good quality, their accessories such as necklaces and bracelets aren\\'t quite as high quality. I\\'ve had these break on me after only a few times out with them, and you can tell just by looking at them that they\\'re pretty frail.\\n\\nAs far as customer service/experience, I went in today, and I have been to the buckle stores a few times. I was greeted when I walked in, and everything was neat and orderly. A young lady name Kat (or Cat) asked if she could help me find anything, and what I was shopping for.\\n\\nWe quickly picked out a few different fits, and from there figured out what washes I preferred. I only had to go into the dressing room once, and Kat even found a few similar styles and sizes for me to try on while I was in there to make sure I was getting the best fit and look I possibly could without having to go back and forth from the dressing room. As a guy.. none of us want to spend a ton of time shopping for jeans, its a nightmare honestly, but Kat made it easy!\\n\\nI also will admit that I don\\'t know a tremendous amount about jeans, but Kat also was on the spot here, telling me about the difference between \"rise\", \"fit\", \"leg opening\", and material, and how this affects the fit and look when they\\'re worn. She even showed me a few different washes in the size/styles I liked that we could order online and have shipped to the store or to my house.\\n\\nOverall it was a great experience, and I appreciate people like Kat that take a great product carried by the store, and make it an easy and pleasurable experience to find, learn about,  and purchase the perfect clothing for the look you want.',\n",
       " 'South Congress Cafe continues to impress me every single time I visit, which lately it has been quite often.  Everything that I have had thus far has been absolutely delicious.  Last time we went we got the appetizer special, which was escargot in jalapeno butter with crostinis.  Those of you who will not dare to try escargot do not know what you are missing.  I am pretty sure my eyes were closed most of the time taking in all of those     flavors and textures the dish had to offer.  For entrees, we ordered the trout almondine  served with lump crab meat and toasted almonds, and the five spice crusted pork tenderloin (my new favorite).  Both dishes were excellent.  The rainbow trout had a nice pan-seared outside and a flaky inside.  The chipotle lime brown butter complimented the fish nicely.  The pork tenderloin stuffed with blue corn chorizo was well prepared and full of flavors.  The ranchero burgundy sauce that it comes with is spicy and delicious.  The tenderloin is served with potato enchiladas to settle down the heat from the sauce, and fresh vegetables that not only added more textures to the dish but beautiful colors as well.  One of the best dishes I have had in a while.  We finished dinner with a coffee (medium house blend)  that hit the spot.  Props to our waiter Tim for adding so much to that evening\\'s dining experience.  \\n\\nThe previous time we ordered the jalapeno venison meatloaf with charred poblano demi-glace on a bed of roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  Talk about comfort food!  All of the components of the dish came together in perfect harmony.  I just wished it was bigger.  The country snapper was also very good, particularly its light panko crust and the guajillo mashed potatoes that it came with.  \\n\\nWhenever I thought South Congress could not top itself, I got the dried cherry and pecan  bread pudding with bourbon sauce.  That dessert deserved a moment of silent.  For those of you who are familiar with my reviews 1) I LOVE bread pudding and will go to places to grade theirs, and 2) I do not like it with ice cream.  So in this case, Amy\\'s Mexican Vanilla ice cream was nowhere in sight.  Even before I tasted it, the aromas of the bourbon and cinnamon were intoxicating me with joy and delight.  As my fork gently cut through the pudding I could see a bit of steam emerging from its warm center.  I think it might have spelled the word \"bliss\".  The cherries were not tart as I had feared.  The pecans were not overwhelming and only emerged in a minuscule way to add a slight crunch to the perfectly-sweetened homemade bread.  \\n\\nIt was simply perfect.',\n",

Love their special lunch menu - salad or appetizer, choice of a few entrees or sandwiches, and then choose between a few different desserts for under $20. Always good. Never a bad lunch there.\\n2. Despite the fact that it\\'s not my go-to place, whenever I have visitors from out of town, they LOVE it there and I like having it in my back-pocket.\\n3. Their Eggplant parm is to DIE for. For reals. Amazingly mild and flavorful eggplant, not bitter at all, and their tomato sauce mixed with their cream sauce. Oh. My. Goodness.\\n4. Their side salad is delish - a great mix of greens, other veggies, and some spicy peppers that aren\\'t too spicy. I don\\'t even put dressing on it.\\n5. Love sitting on their patio in the summer and then going to see a movie. Such a relaxing date.\\n6. Took my mom there for Christmas Eve last year (get a reservation!) and we had a two hour meal. It was grand and the service was fabulous.\\n\\nNow, the meh:\\n1. In the winter, when you can\\'t sit outside, it\\'s a bit crowded, dim, and loud. This is a common theme in my reviews. I\\'m not a fan of crowded loud places. If you are, then disregard this. Honestly, it\\'s not that bad, I just struggle to filter out background noise.\\n2. I can\\'t drink wine and their cocktails are good but not great\\n3. Menu is good, and nothing on it is less than good. Things are prepared just so, and lots of fresh ingredients. But the menu has been basically the same for three years and nothing on it (except the eggplant parm! See above) is so amazing as to eclipse other places rendition or so creative as to cause one to think, \"I have to go there again soon!\"\\n4. It is pricey.

Practically living on Yelp, why didn\\'t I think of that. So, my friend Lee goes on, \"Check them out. They have a million reviews and they still have 5 stars.\" He told me that he sends all his old customers there and he\\'s heard no complaints.\\n\\nSo I Yelped them and Lee was right. And if you know how to read Yelp, you know a shill review from a real review, and these were real reviews by real people. You also know that anyone with 99 reviews and a full 5 stars has to be doing something right, and they are.\\n\\nI called Jennifer and talked to her. She sounded intelligent and pleasant. I described the move and she said, \"you could go with 3, but I\\'d recommend 4 guys.\" I thought about it for a day, looked over the other cheesy estimates I\\'d gotten, and although Precision\\'s estimate was much higher than the others, but I I suspected it to be more accurate.\\n\\nI decided to drive in to Somerville and see their facility and meet Jennifer. Finding it to be well established, clean and organized, I booked the job with Jen and picked up my $50 worth of free boxes.\\n\\nYou get a lot of boxes for $50 at Precision. And they\\'re good boxes; U-Haul quality good for a lot less per box. (BTW - do yourself a favor and stay away from Home Depot boxes. Flimsy, fall apart, and not at all rectangular. Whatever shape they do approximate is one where the flaps don\\'t even come close to meeting when you try to seal them.)\\n\\nOn moving day, my crew was Bo, Phil, Iztvan and Bella. They showed up promptly at 9AM, they looked strong and well rested, and immediately took  a walk-through of the house.  Bo told me right away \"We might not get this done today, but we\\'ll try,\" and they launched right into moving me out of the top two floors of a 3 decker, and basement into temporary storage a couple hours away.\\n\\nAnd they flew through it. These guys worked their butts off. None of this \"2 guys will carry and 1 guy holds the door thing.\" Each guy moved things by himself that I could have sworn would take two guys. One guy moved a cube safe by himself! By himself, on his shoulder like it was a sack of flour! It was men in perpetual motion and they had filled the truck - to the top - by 1 \\'clock. And it was starting to snow... and it was forecast to snow hard. I was worried - a full truck meant that getting it all into the storage space would be iffy.\\n\\nThey took less than 2 1/2 hours to get to the space. Having driven it before, I can tell you this: IF they stopped for lunch, it was to pick it up at a drive through and eat it on the road. They mooooved.\\n\\nAt the other end... allow me to digress. Have you ever heard of the Theory of Nominative Determinism? It suggests that \"...a person\\'s name is given an influential role in reflecting key attributes of his job, profession, or general life,\" like a guy named Larry Speakes will grow up to be a White House spokesman, and a girl named \"Eileen\" will limp? And then there\\'s the aforementioned member of this moving squad, \"Phil.\" I guess the theory holds up for homonyms. \\n\\nThese guys work as fast in reverse as they do forward. Three of them unloaded and Phil worked inside the space arranging, stacking, shifting, rearranging and re-stacking, filling every cubic centimeter of the unit. Absolutely amazing. Like backwards Jenga.\\n\\nIt was after 6 PM and snowing hard - almost blizzard conditions and the stuff was piling up.- when they finished. They flat rated their return trip to Somerville at 2 hours. Maybe they made it in that time, but I\\'m pretty sure they saved me an hour or more on the back end.\\n\\nThis move was expensive, don\\'t get me wrong. But it did cost what Jennifer said it would cost, and it did cost what I had already figured it would cost. This crew took on a tough job with enthusiasm and good spirit and carried it through to the end.\\n\\nI could not rate any experience more highly than this.

I felt properly hipster in there.\\n\\nOur food was good- like it normally is since they've done the menu makeover- but I don't know if it was because it was a holiday or what, but the staff kind of made me feel guilty for ordering sushi when their wasn't any made. Twice! If that is your trick to get me to tip more, you did an excellent job, sirs!\\n\\nAlso, the cashier was playing around with his smartphone while it was somewhat busy. Call me old fashion, but wait until we can't see you texting so we don't quietly judge you!\",\n",
       " 'I ordered the chocolate delight cake and the ricotta pie for a work event.  Based on the name and how the lady described it, it sounded like a chocolate lovers dream. It looked beautiful. However it was not true to its name but mostly whipped cream with a caramel sticky center that made it impossible to cut neatly. Did not know about the weird caramel center until I cut into it. Would be nice if the website or employee provided a better description. It was a bit embarrassing trying to cut it in front of 30 people as it was a whipped creamy mess so it did not slice well and just flopped. It was not chocolaty at all.  If you love whipped cream this is the cake for you. The name of the cake is very deceiving.  The ricotta pie was pleasant, not great but not bad and not too sweet. No one commented good or bad but silent speaks louder than words. :/ Will not order this particular cake again. Overpriced at $52 for 12 inch.',\n",
       " 'I walked in early afternoon, and my initial impression was very, very nice.  The salon was clean! The salon owner, Tamara, greeted us right away and was very pleasant.  The nail color selection was smaller, but I liked the fact they had a good selection of O.P.I. and Essie in all the colors that are in style right now.  Tamara did my pedicure and she was very friendly.  She even offered me tips on taking care of my nails at home in between manicures and pedicures!  I liked that she established a rapport with me right away.  By the end of my visit I knew all the ladies and they were all professional.  The prices are pretty reasonable and I like the menu of services that they have.  If you are looking for \"Official\" nail care this is your place. I will be back!',\n",

       " 'Good food. I tried the sesame chicken with fried rice and the royal ginger roll. The roll was delicious. The chicken was good. Would have like more green beans to be mixed in and the sauce was a little too salty. But I enjoyed it and would get it again. The fried rice had little pieces of pineapple mixed In and that was great. It made it different from other places and gave it an added sweetness which I enjoyed. I also had the typhoon margarita and it was very good as well. It also had pineapple juice which gave it a different twist. The food took a little longer to come than I though it should (about 30 min.) but it was a Friday night and they were busy.',\n",

       "['DO NOT SHOP HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  BE FOREWARNED!!  I wishe that I could give this place NEGATIVE FIVE STARS !!!  I have only written one other review as I generally do not have time to write reviews. However, I felt incredibly compelled to share my RETAIL NIGHTMARE experience with fellow Yelp patrons.   Last Saturday, I went into the Spirit Halloween Store with my 6 year old son to look for a Skeleton Costume for Halloween. I was next door at Marshall\\'s so it seemed convenient. This is a  \"Fly by Night\" Seasonal Retail shop (temporary lease from Out of Business Circuit City).   When I first walked in, I noticed a huge amount of seemingly well stocked  Halloween paraphernalia. I finally located an employee and asked where I might find a Skeleton Costume to fit my son. She took me to the far corner where the closest match was a Zombie skeleton and they had only two costumes (different sizes) !! That seemed strange as one would think that it was a relatively common or popular item. The price was listed as $29 which seemed high considering the quaulity was so low, but WTH it is a seasonal item.  One of them seemed close, and she did say that I could try it on, but there was only one very small and busy area to change so we \"eyeballed it\" and she told me that I could return it for a refund, but had to do so the same day as this was the last day for refunds and afterwards I could only return it for exchange. I went up to the register only to discover that it was actually $ 39 before tax!! I almost left, but decided to purchase it anyway caveating my decision by stating that I might have to return it for a refund later if it did not work out. She said that this would be fine.   When I got home, I discovered that the cloth was made of the thinnest guaze that tore with your touch and the entire outfit was poorly designed and did not fit.   I repacked it and took it back to the store for refund a few hours later. When I arrived back at the store, there was a huge line at the register and I saw two clerks including the \"goth dressed girl\"  one that had waited on me, the two customers being waited on when I stepped into line were still being waited on 20 minutes later!!! Then the one girl left the register, leaving only one clerk behind to wait on the 9-10  customers in front of me in line. Ten minutes later and the lone clerk was still assisting the same customer that she was when I arrived 30 minutes prior. Finally the goth chick returned with an older female employee with a huge bleached and teased head of hair (not a wig), I was later to learn that her name was \"Sugar\" and that she was the Manager.  Now we finally had three at the register. Thirty minutes later, I finally made it to the register manned by the employee that had assited me hours earlier with my return and receipt in hand. I explained that it did not work out and that I needed to return it for a refund. She stated that Refunds are not allowed under any circumstances. I reminded her of our conversation earlier and she lied and stated that she had never stated that but rather had toild me that that day was the last day to even EXCHANGE an item. In other words they would not even exchange defective merchandise from October 18th through the 31st !!! I mentioned that that was definetely not what she told me and that I would not have purchased the item under those circumstances and that I had mentioned that during the purchase process. I asked to speak to a manager and that\\'s when SUGAR chimed in and stated that this girl was the assistant Mgr. and that she (SUGAR) was the MANAGER! She went on to say that that was the policy and my only option was to keep the merchandise or exchange it for a replacement item immediately (ie. I could not receive a credit or even come back later that day) and of course wait for another hour in line. I explained that this was outrageous and unacceptable and she screamed at me and yelled that I needed to leave \"Her\" store immediately!!!! I demanded a phone number for the company and asked for her full name, which she gave me.    I left feeling that I had already had my Halloween experience in the House of Horrors!  I will follow up with them, but be forewarned, this store is full of cheap, very overpriced merchandise, rude employees and awful policies.   There are many choices in Austin. DON\\'T SHOP HERE!!',\n",
       " 'I laughed when my wife told me the double-digit room rate she got for our pre-Christmas trip to Orlando. Busy season, with a free shuttle to Universal?  HA!  I was half hoping for a worst case scenario nightmare stay, since she is always right and I needed a few points to support my ego problem.  No point for me.  She did it again.  The room was good as any Marriott or Hilton I\\'ve stayed in.  Clean, large, no smells, there was even a microwave and small fridge.  They TV was a new 40\" and the beds were good.  No complaints.  The kicker was the free breakfast.  While the menu didn\\'t vary while we were there, there was a wide enough selection that you could have something different for breakfast every day.  Hot selections included eggs, sausage, biscuits, gravy, and home fries.  There were waffle machines (which I hate to be around), a selection of bagels and fruits, yogurt, etc.    Late nights at the parks meant we never made it to the free happy hour or dinner, but I would have definitely been there for it had I been staying on business.  (We did eat our dinner from the Wendy\\'s next door in the eating area because it was so much more relaxing and had free soda.)  Two things differentiated this place from all the others I\\'ve been to:    1. Unlike most resort free breakfast setups, this one is actually well maintained and has more seats than people.  There was constantly someone checking the supplies, replacing something, cleaning something, or just saying \"good morning.\"  I swear, I saw the manager walking around the place every morning we were there...an extremely happy guy that appears to love his job.    2.  The staff was outstanding.  Everyone I spoke to was eager to assist, seemed happy to be there, and asked how we were doing.  I\\'ve gotten that at $400/night places, but not so much when traveling with the family on a budget.  Don\\'t undervalue a friendly face after a day of dealing with lines at Universal or Disney.  Summary:  Highly recommended.  Excellent value.',\n",
       " 'My partner and I were tenants at this property for a year.   1. The location is perfect--close to the north end, across the TD Garden, a few steps away from Quincy Marker, and a 15 minute walk to downtown Boston.   2. The concierge is wonderful-- very attentive and engaged with the community.   3. Compared to other buildings, this property has relatively decent amenities.  4. Management is perhaps the worst. The manager and staff do not care about residents; they do not respond to requests; are unfriendly driven by new tenants rather than keeping existing tenants and are not able to create any feeling of community.',\n",
       " 'After about five facials, two haircuts, two hair colors, a wash and style, and one pedicure, I think I am more than prepared to write a review of the Aveda Institute! My experience has been great. Aveda products, especially hair products, have been my favorite for close to 10 years now. The school educates the students in how to use and recommend the products and they do well for the most part. The evaluation forms are too general and don\\'t cover professionalism or if the esthetician missed a step, which happens more than it should.   The best part of the institute is the spa, specifically the facials. One of my first service was a pedicure and while it was relaxing, it does not involve serious exfoliation nor does the polish last. Since the summer, I have had a facial every month or so. I have had facials before at full-price salons and the ones here are comparable. There have been times when I need to remind or ask the student for something I knew should be part of the facial simply because I had it before, like extractions. However, they have been consistently great.   If you are particular about your hair, then I don\\'t recommend just making an appointment and crossing you fingers. The school has different tiers, and so you can request a student with more hours of experience, which is second tier. I actually came for a wash and style in order to get a feel for the institute and see if the student you are paired with is one you want to cut your hair. The students are to consult with the instructors before they start and then instructors are to talk with the clients after to assess the students. The instructors are good but need to be more attentive to the students\\' professionalism. I strongly suggest that the client-instructor interview be done in private. Why? Because it is uncomfortable to tell the instructor about even little problems when 1) The instructor demonstrates a strong affinity to the student and 2) A student or group of students are within listening distance and watching.  My first wash and style was an informative experience on how these students need forthright client feedback. First, you need to tell the client what to expect with the service. The \"wash and style\" is just a wash and blow dry. If you want a curling iron or or flat iron, that costs extra. This was not explained to me until my student skipped the part when she was to tell me about what she planned to do to my hair. When I asked, she was short with me, treated me like an insolent child, and had the instructor explain it. I controlled my anger. She also didn\\'t talk to me about products. Certain Aveda products work well with my hair while others don\\'t. When I said something, she rolled her eyes towards her instructor (there are mirrors, sweetheart, I saw that). For most of the service, she talked with a student nearby and right in my ear. When she washed my hair, she disregard which products I wanted; she over-conditioned my hair and made it smell strongly on tree bark, not what I was looking for on a girls\\' night out. If this wasn\\'t an Aveda school, I would never have returned, but I assumed this was a fluke and now I felt more confident in what to expect.   The student I now see regularly is meticulous and attentive. She stays focused during the service to make sure I am happy with the progress. She is thorough in her discussions with her instructor about her plans. Yes, she has a plan and she explains the process of the cut, the color, and style at each step. When I told her of my first experience, she was very professional and made a good point: not all students realize that communication is necessary in meeting their clients\\' needs. For example, I prefer my hair be flat ironed, but she said 1) my hair could be straightened nicely without the flat iron and 2) that she would show me what product to use and how to blow dry my hair so that it would have the same effect. The difference between her and the other student was like night and day!  All the services are half the cost of an Aveda salon, so the ability to have an Aveda service for such a low cost is wonderful. Also, of you are a last minute scheduler like I am, then you will rarely have a problem getting in. You can make a donation to the student (instead of a tip) and making an appointment at the end of the service gives them added credit, so keep that in mind if you really like your student! For the price, it is an excellent deal. However, they have changed their pricing, so make sure you 1) Look on the website at the services and understand what each includes then 2) Ask the cost when you make the appointment. and 3) It will take 2 times as long as other places because it is a school. Making an appointment is frustrating. It seems too involved and there are often glitches and problems with entering data. The receptionists are friendly and nice during that time.',\n",
       " \"Back when I used to grade papers as a teacher I'd give out 100% if you nailed it. As in... you knew all the material I asked about.  Now, I'll give you 5 stars if there is nothing I think you could improve about your service.  Economy Plumbing gets 5 stars.  Here's why:  They have a appointment setting service that answers the phone and coordinates appointments.   They are electronic: emailed appointment confirmation, email estimates, email receipts and invoices.   The staff on the phone is polite and efficient.   The staff (Roger) that did my estimate and work was great.   ESTIMATE REVIEW: On time, great at explaining my options. Provided estimates for the different options I could choose. (Use their toilet, use a toilet I picked out, have the toilet re-built) . No pressure trying to get me to pick on or the other.  I also asked about some possible leak in the tub area. Roger gave me some great common sense advice and said I likely don't even have a problem to worry about.  A less honest guy would've tried to convince me to tear my walls open.  I'm happy with the work he did do as well as the work he said wasn't needed.   WORK COMPLETION:  Roger just left, I have 2 toilets installed. He had given me some suggestions on the types I should look for and where I could do it myself if I wanted.  Toilets are installed and all is well. Not only did they take the old ones, but they took all the box debris as well. Oh... and they left the work area clean. Bonus. And their goal of  no more running toilet? Complete. The cranky old toilet that couldn't be bothered to flush is no longer of this earth. Bye bye! Perhaps more importantly ... now I get to see a lower water bill. Yes! :)  Will I call them again when I need them? Yup. 5 stars.\",\n",

       " 'I am not a customer here, but as a healthcare worker I come here frequently as part of my job.  I can say that this is one of the worst medical centers in the city. Their staff is overworked and it shows in how they interact with allied healthcare personnel and their patients. Walking into the ER feels more like walking into a room of juvenile high school students gossiping about one another and their patients.   The staff is extremely rude and I can say both from first hand experience and from discussing with other health care personnel that most of the staff cares more about getting patients out of the building as quickly as possible than educating or helping people.   This place is a product of profits over patients. They only want your money and want to make you a repeat customer. They run on a bare minimum staff (most of whom are, admittedly, underpaid- which may explain why they are all so unhappy) and are not able to meet the needs of Dekalb County. Several times a week the hospital is filled to capacity and they are unable to accept any more patients.   Do yourself and the staff at DMC a favor. Go somewhere else.',\n",
       " 'Two words. Rude and Shady. In the city of Boston, all tow companies are SUPPOSED TO HAVE AN AUTHORIZATION PROVIDED BY THE DISPATCH COMPANY BEFORE THEY HOOK A CAR FOR A TOW.   Allston. I hate this disgusting city. When I visit my friend he calls his landlord every time I\\'m there, then his landlord calls Roberts towing and tells them my car make and plate, (it\\'s a vanity plate, NOT hard to forget) saying \"hey this car is authorized to park.\"   Tonight I parked visible to Longs Ave. not even 5 minutes at my friends we hear a tow truck swarming. Good thing I was there. According to this employee \"Because my car didn\\'t have that white Roberts towing sticker\" I was guilty.   When I asked this cowboy why he\\'s towing my car he had the balls to tell me to \"let him do his job\" after he hooks up my Mini. THEN he called his dispatch to ask if my car was authorized to park on Long Ave. YEAH IT WAS! My friend asked the driver if he would have called in my plate before he towed it if we weren\\'t there. He said \"oh of course.\" REALLY?! Would you have really?! Find that hard to believe seeing that\\'s protocol before you take someone\\'s private property.    Back up, Roberts.  Stop being so greedy and assuming everyone is parked illegally. Follow the Massachusetts laws and start towing like professionals.   Maybe this company can take these stupid college kids for a ride. This isn\\'t my first rodeo. Not only should I have called boston PD, I will be filing a complaint with whoever I can Monday morning. I am sure Roberts could careless. If I could give these people less than a star I would.  8/19 so it\\'s Roberts policy to hook up a car before they find out if they\\'re a no tow? Are you kidding me? Is that even legal?   I\\'m not claiming anything I have three witnesses. You even said your driver \"didn\\'t recognize my car and thought I was good to tow\". HOW THE HELL WOULD HE KNOW THAT WITHOUT CALLING YOU FIRST? Why couldn\\'t he have called while in the street? Why did he have to come up the driveway and hook my fregin car. You don\\'t get why I\\'m upset because it didn\\'t happen to you or your personal property. This is my review and I\\'m not sorry.',\n",
       " 'Fancy-shmancy! It was all rehearsed. \"Watch your step, ma\\'am.\" Alrighty, will do! You know you are at a fancy restaurant when the servers carry crumbers to whisk away those pesky little food droppings that absolutely RUIN the white tablecloth. I had to use the restroom twice while I was here. A different employee showed me how to get there both times-- but get this-- they actually WALKED me there. None of that, \"You go around the corner here and hang a right.\" It was, \"Let me guide you.\" One time I really thought the lady was going to follow me in there and flush the toilet for me when I was done. It was kinda awkward. Like I kept looking over my shoulder like, is she going to walk away now?   I digress. We got down on the $25 3-course meal deal from Buckhead Restaurant Week. I ordered the fillet and they overcooked it, but not to worry because they corrected that immediately.  I am very picky about my cocktail drinks and our server Courtney did everything in his power to make sure they were just the way I liked them.   The food... honestly, I\\'ve had much, much better. The steak was very decent but served in a brown gravy sauce (who DOES that??). The creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were just okay. I\\'ve heard raves about the lobster mac and cheese, so we also decided to try that. Huge disappointment. The pasta was dry and frankly it didn\\'t resemble mac and cheese at all. Just some crusty noodles in a thin cheese-colored (not flavored) mixture. For desert I got the espresso cake which was very delicious.   Overall... this place has a great atmosphere and superb service (hence the 4 stars) but for the prices on the menu I expected more out of the food...

       " 'We spent 5 nights at the Buena Vista Palace as part of a packaged Disney vacation we purchased through AMEX.    Buena Vista Palace is a mixed bag.  Here is what you need to know:  The Good:  1.  Very convenient location.  You can\\'t get much closer to Disney without staying at an actual Disney operated resort.  It is walking distance from Downtown Disney and it is on a Disney shuttle route operated by Mears transportation.   2.  Economical.  Relative to other options, particularly Disney operated resort, it is economical.  I think we saved $1k over a 4 night stay at a Disney resort we had priced.  3.  Reliable Transportation To Disney.  They offer shuttle service approximately every 30 minutes to and from the Disney Theme parks until an hour or so after the parks close.  It isn\\'t perfect but we managed to stay here without a rental car for the 5 days we were visiting.  4.  Spacious Suites.  The suites are very comfortably sized and larger than average suite we are used to staying in at other hotels.  We stayed in a one bed one and half bath suite and were really able to spread out.  When you are traveling with small children this is a big plus.  That said as tired as we were from long days at the parks we really did only use the hotel for sleeping.    5.  Free WIFI.  6.  They offer a kids eat free package.  We didn\\'t get to eat many meals here as we ate at the theme parks most days but the two meals we were served were free for the kids.   The Bad:  1.  We booked a two queen sized bed suite.  They put us in a one king sized bed suite our first night and couldn\\'t move us until the next day.  To their credit, they did move all our belongings to the correct room the next day while we were at the Magic Kingdom.  2.  The layout.  The Buena Vista Palace consists of a primary tower and a detached and separate \"Islander Building\".  I don\\'t know what the tower is like but the Islander Building is separated from the main tower and all of the hotel services (except housekeeping) by a bayou, a pool, and lots of landscape.  It\\'s a long ass haul from the front desk to your room.  There are no staff assigned to the Islander building.  Once you are there you really are on the island.  You better have exact change if you want a coke from the coke machine in the building.  If you want to go the gym, business office, minimart, arcade, restaurants, bar etc plan on packing some comfortable shoes because you have a long walk ahead of you.   3.  Shuttle start time.  The shuttles start at 8 am.  If you want to be at the them parks when they open at 8 you aren\\'t going to make it on the shuttle service.  The service is shared among a variety of hotels in the Downtown Disney area.  At times they get quite crowded.  Be prepared to stand a lot especially on the way back.  Buena Vista Palace is the last stop on the route before the shuttle returns to Disney World.   The Ugly:  1.  Outside of the street level floor of the main tower the carpets throughout the lower level of the tower and the Islander building are absolutely filthy looking.  We have two small kids and a dog and we don\\'t have near this many stains on our carpets at home.  This applies to the common areas and the rooms themselves.  They are long overdue for replacement.  The wall paper is disrepair as well in the halls of the Islander building.  One expects more from a resort with respect to decor.  The good outweighs the bad at Buena Vista Palace but not by a wide margin.  I would stay again if I couldn\\'t find a better alternative to try out.',\n",
       " 'Rented from this horrific company thru Travelocity. Initially all was great. Smooth pick up from MCO for myself, husband and 2 kids, clean facility and nice clean car that was agreed upon based on my booking. It was downhill from there. First off they sales tactics they use are basically scare tactics. Like trying to upsell you insurance you don\\'t need after you tell them you have full coverage insurance as well as added insurance thru your credit card company. Then they try to push the whole toll device or whatever it is in my case for $20 for 2 days. Next was the fact that they stated that their terms weren\\'t the same as what my booking with Travelocity stated regarding the overages charges (daily & hourly rates past our return time). They were 3x more. I showed my reservation to them which didn\\'t seem to matter. They would not honor it. So what do you do now? They\\'ve picked you up from the airport, there is nothing else around so now you\\'re at their mercy. So you are forced to sign something that is not what you agreed on on your initial reservation. We take our rental car and I proceed to contact Travelocity who puts me on hold for 10 mins as they talk to them. Travelocity confirms the same thing and tell me they\\'re advised the same thing and that they have to update their page. Next I call the corporate office of Priceless and speak to an individual there who assures me she will do the research and take care of this for me. The only great part of this experience was working with her. I\\'m assured she will take care of it and get back to me. Fast forward to the return of the vehicle. I\\'m met by the same employee who checked me in and ask her to speak to her manager after I tell her both Travelocity & their corporate was involved. She stated she didn\\'t see any notes and goes back to get her manager. Out comes this older man whom I explain EVERYTHING all over again. He denies anyone ever called from Travelocity or the Corporate office. Funny thing is I showed him the call log with Travelocity and the fact I was on hold when they were speaking to their facility as well as the email from the Corporate office. He proceeds to tell me I signed the contract when I left agreeing to THEIR terms. I proceed to tell him we had no choice since we were stuck at their facility and it wasn\\'t good business practice when I was showing proof of everything. He was extremely rude and stated their was nothing he was will to do to correct the mistake. I responded that I would provide the documentation to my credit card company and resolve it that way. He became extremely irate to which at that point I had to walk away. When my husband went back in to finish up the return process he asked my husband if I was his wife and when my husband responded that I was he responded with \"I feel sorry for you\" My husband had to put him in his place. He also refused to provide any receipt showing any of the charges and only provided a copy of the initial receipt that we got when we picked up. This also very unprofessional.   At this place the customer service is non  existent. There were people there complaining and screaming when we were picking up as well as another customer other than us when we were dropping off. They have an armed security guard, hmmm I wonder why, because they are constantly treating people like this and need the security because the kind of things they say to their customers like they did with my husband. Whatever you do, DO NOT do business with this company!! Save yourself the headaches and spend the extra money for the rental companies at the airport!!!',\n",

Lots of parking available, table space, they even have a spacious outside seating.  When you walk in, they have their menu's hanging on a rack and it's two sided no fuss menu.  Although the font is a little small, it's doable to read.   I love ordering their empanada's here.  The cuban empanada with the chicken filling is my favorite! Something about the crust and how the chicken is seasoned is really good.  If you order a sandwich, i highly recommend the PATACON! oh my gosh, SO GOOD!! Instead of your typical sandwich with bread, your sandwich is in between two crispy plaintains, lettuce, shredded beef (option of pork too if you wanted another choice), a garlic sauce and something else that added was delicious.  It's a very flavorful sandwich, and very filling.  Must have! Their entree's are also really good to order, lots of options and hefty serving of food.  Every entree comes with 3 sides and a side salad.  Hello, worth your money!  I've had the pollo plancha and the churrasco.  Both VERY good.

She has always somehow known how I wanted my hair, and is always able to keep it long while cutting off just the right amount so my hair looks healthy again. She once gave me awesome thick bangs which I loved, too. She always does something a little special with my hair afterwards (curls and styles it), plus she gives a neck and head massage to boot :)   I personally love the care this salon takes with their clients, so friendly and accommodating! For $40 for a haircut, that's pretty good and a little bit below average in Van. It used to be $35, but hey, i'm not complaining! Salon's down in Seattle range about $50, so Ark is the right price for me (plus I get to chow down on great Vancouver Sushi right after my haircut!)  Try it out, you'll love it :)\",\n",
       " \"The concept of Flip is fairly simple - burgers, sides, and shakes - American classics that everyone can identify with. But when the creative consultant behind the concept is local celebrity chef, Richard Blais, you can expect the simple classics to have some very modern updates.  Located on Howell Mill just past Chattahoochee Avenue, Flip Burger Boutique looks and feels like a retro burger joint with Sex and the City flair. From the outside of the building, large windows reveal a dimly lit dining space with patrons swathed in flattering candlelight. The interior aesthetic could be best described as a post-modern Johnny Rocket's. Stark white predominates, highlighted by flashes of red and chrome. A bar flanks almost the entire length of the room, opposite a few cushy benches set into intimate alcoves. In the center of the space, two rows of adjoining high-top tables create a communal feel, which is ideal, since you'll invariably be tempted to peek over to see which of Flip's many gourmet burgers your neighbor settled on. At the rear of the restaurant is the open-air kitchen where you can observe two chefs feverishly churning out the goods.  The burger offerings are split into two categories, beef (organic, of course) and 'flip'- non-beef alternatives that will satisfy vegetarians, those who shun red meat, and anyone with a hankering for a pork patty. All of the burgers are slider-sized and served on buns that are part-Kaiser, part Hawaiian sweet roll. Actually, they're more like sliders on steroids, so depending on how hungry you are, one might suffice, but two are recommended for larger appetites and for indecisives like me and my friends. Among the three of us, we sampled 4 different selections:  From the Beef side: Butcher - with red wine jelly, caramelized onion and Cabrales blue cheese, this burger was my absolute favorite. The red wine jelly and caramelized onion added a hint of sweet and a lot of savory, while the tiny amount of Cabrales blue packed a tangy, funky punch.  Southern - featuring a fried patty w/pimento cheese, was definitely my least favorite. I'm not a huge fan of pimento cheese, plus the super-crispy coating encasing the burger shredded the roof of my mouth. Not fun.  From the Flip side: Po Boyger - A shrimp patty topped with lettuce, tomato, a fried lemon slice and Old Bay mayo. Delicate flavors, but still very very tasty. I was pleased that the patty wasn't overly pureed, and I could still identify what I was eating as shrimp.  Bun Mi - An interpretation of the Vietnamese banh mi hoagie-style sandwich. This burger features a ground pork patty topped with cilantro and pickled veggies. It's spicy, exotic, and complex - I can definitely see it becoming one of the restaurant's more popular creations.  For our sides we ordered a sampling of sweet potato tots, french fries, and vodka battered onion rings. Accompanying them were ketchup, a dill mayo, and a honey mustard. Fries and rings were decent, nothing terribly remarkable about either. The tots were slightly disappointing - while the flavor was great, the texture was more mushy than crispy.  For dessert, we ordered one of each of the shakes on the menu - The Krispy Kreme and the chocolate. The Krispy Kreme actually has doughnuts blended into the vanilla ice cream base, and the chocolate shake comes topped with marshmallows given the hand-torch toasting just before being served. The shakes are cooled with liquid nitrogen, which aside from just sounding, well...cool, actually makes for a thick, creamy treat that stays that way until the last slurp.  My bill - which included 2 burgers, a side, and a shake - came to over $20. With the baby burgers averaging about $8, it'll be interesting to see how well the restaurant performs after the initial excitement wears off and the reality of a tight economy settles back in.  cheers,  k www.bonvivantonline.com\",\n",

The tempting smell of pie filled the air and the wine display drew us to the bar area.      The restaurant has a clean look to it.  Black and white interior, a sleek granite bar and wine glasses perfectly placed on each table. The ambiance was reminiscent of the former Joe DiMaggio\\'s.  We sat at the bar and had a nice malbec and ordered the \"coal vines regular pie\" with 1/2 pepperoni and the other 1/2 pepperoni and sausage.  We had to wait a bit as during certain hours they are open but the oven is not ready to fire up pies, when it was placed in front of us we agreed it was worth the wait. I usually stop at one slice but I liked the pizza enough to indulge. I especially liked the sausage. The menu does not include a happy hour but the price point is fair.  Bottom line is, if  on 2nd street if you are craving pizza and a happy hour, head to Taverna\\'s.  If  you are seeking a tad more romantic dining experience but still desire pizza and vino, come to Coal Vines.',\n",
       " 'You know how it is.  You\\'ve been locked into a situation for 7 years or so, and as good as that situation might be, your eyes wander.  You think maybe the grass might be greener, and even if it\\'s isn\\'t, you\\'d really like to know what it\\'s like, on the other side of the fence.  Last night, I cheated on my beloved Alamo.  There was a new, shiny place in town who flashed her mixed drinks and her overstuffed chairs at me.  \"Come on, give me a try,\" she whispered.  \"I have time for you when the Alamo doesn\\'t.\"  And last night, when my beloved Alamo was already busy with her other beaux at Pacific Rim, I gave into temptation.  First, be warned that this place wants to know everything about you.  It\\'s goofy, but it\\'s $4 cheaper to buy a ticket if you first give them your demographic data by joining their \"club.\"  She wants to know exactly what your prospects are, I guess.  When arriving, I got a sense of the way iPic rolls.  The interior is totally Dallas or Houston these days - which means 1990s Manhattan.  It\\'s shiny and \"upwardly mobile professional,\" and generally makes you wonder if anybody who isn\\'t made of plastic ever chooses to drink there.  But it\\'s also geared for mass throughput in a way that whispers, \"MBAs who study McDonalds.\"  This is the kind of place that calls the crappy seats, \"Premium\" and the decent seats, \"Premium Plus.\"  I don\\'t know why they didn\\'t just name them, \"Venti\" and \"Grande.\"  We got a bottle of very-marked-up Dr. Loosen Riesling ($35, where you can get it for about $12 on the street - and we had to open it and pour it ourselves) and took it to the front, near-center seats - and while they looked comfortable, my back is now (the next day) hurting and my neck has a krick.  The whole time, I kept trying to get comfortable.  Meanwhile, I also found out that the seats where you actually get wait service are more expensive than the \"premium\" ones - $10 more.  That ends up to being quite a bit more expensive than the Alamo is. If you don\\'t cough up the $10, not only are you stuck in the \"back killer\" seats, they\\'ll take your order at the \"restaurant\" counter in the lobby and give you a beeper and summon you when your food is ready.  They also don\\'t communicate this very well - after I was beeped to retrieve my food from the lobby, the famished woman sitting next to me looked at my meal and said in a hushed tone, \"where did you get that?  They told us at the bar that they only had drinks and snack.\"  Ah, foolish woman, you should have asked ten feet to the left of where you were.  I suppose the more expensive seats would be more comfortable to look at the screen, and have wait service - but what price do I put on my self-respect?  Higher than $10, I say.  Plus, the good seats were sold out.  If we didn\\'t have Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, I might be thrilled with this attempt to milk/make an upscale alternative to the Googleplex movie experience, but this place just feels under-clued, over-exploitive, and more glitz than fun.  I can\\'t say I completely regret seeing how things are with iPic, but I do have to acknowledge that for the most part I now just feel dirty and cheap.  Alamo, please forgive me.',\n",

They were also very helpful when deciding between beers and offered samples of the beers on tap if you wanted to try any.\",\n",
       " '* Best of the current bunch *  Surprisingly the Vancouver area does not have a strong set of Malaysian food options. So hearing that there was a good one all the way out in New West (and having tried their North Van location and liking it), I figured it was time to make the journey to the original location.    Started off with the gado gado.  The peanut sauce was served nicely warm and had good well rounded flavours.  The veggies included sprouts, lettuce, cucumbers, green beans, and potatoes.  There was also some lightly fried tofu and a hard boiled egg.  Overall this was a good rendition.  The veggies were crisp, and the sauce tasty.  Overall a nice plate.

There was a proper hint of belachan, but it could have used just a pinch more. The heat level was nice too, as I requested it hot.  Overall a very nice rendition.

Non-description signage makes it a tad hard to find - down a flight of stairs and the bar itself is like one long corridor with band at the far end.   It is an old school, funky basement space on Congress. Intimate performance space, good acoustics, slightly run down but comfortable. A mixed crowd from college students to seniors.  The staff here are friendly, the beer choices are very good, and the mixed drinks are strong, they have NO FOOD so you better eat first.',\n",

I contacted the realtor and signed up for the Charlesgate website since it seemed like they had good properties and good reviews.  I got an initial prompt response to my query, but instead of offering to show me the property I wanted, the realtor asked me to fill out a questionaire about what I was looking for.  After giving LOTS of detail about myself, my roommate, where we wanted to live, what amenities we needed, what amenities we wanted, etc, I never heard back!  Admittedly, I\\'m not looking for a $5k/month apartment, so I\\'m not exactly a high-reward customer, but I would have at least appreciated a blow-off email (\"we don\\'t have anything with those requirements\"), even though I know they had apartments that would work for me.

       " \"Pijiu belly is new restaurant in Westside that had its soft opening last Tuesday(12/09/2014). They call themselves a pub fare restaurant with Asian influence. I had a chance to try their food for lunch. Pijiu means beer - I am not sure they named the restaurant beer belly or the belly is a reference to pork belly in their menu. Regardless, it's always nice to see new restaurants.   The restaurant is located on left, if you are driving from GA tech campus and 85, on 10th street, past north avenue and right across the street from sherwin Williams store. The parking is in a lot, right next to the restaurant. Currently it's a self park, but I hear it's going to valet parking in the future. The lot will fill up to 18 cars but they also have another lot up the street.   When you enter you will see the prominent bar with granite counter, bar stools and TVs. On the left there is small area for dart boards and pool tables(not complete yet but I was told that the plan). There are several high bar tables on the right side area with 6 seating each and regular tables with 4 seating in the back, behind the bar. It has a modern-industrial style.   The menu is rather simple for now - but they will have a revised menu with more items during their grand opening in January. It has charcuterie plates, starters, burgers and sandwiches, sides and beverages. And of course they have beer menu on the board as well. Taking about beer, they don't have beer on tap installed yet but I was told that it will be ready by end of the week with large selections.   From charcuterie selection, I ordered la cabana - soft goat milk cheese made in Spain with rosemary crust. I liked the cheese but it wasn't as soft as I expected it to be. I also ordered, spicy soppressata - Italian made spicy pork cured meat and it was delicious. The plate was served with strawberry jam, pineapple chutney, Dijon mustard and balsamic reduction.($4 each and $11 for three).   I also ordered, 'The Pijiu burger' based on recommendation from the bartender. It had fried egg, kimchi, cheese, beer-bbq sauce on brioche bread and served with hand-cut fries, onion, tomato and pickles. ($13)   The burger had complex flavors and tasty, thanks to the runny egg yolk, kimchi, onion and beer-bbq sauce. It all works well together. My only gripe is that kimchi was quite oversalted for my taste and it kind of takes away the experience a bit. I liked it overall but would have loved it if they had salted kimchi just right. Strangely, there was no salt at all in the pickles and it was spicy!! I mean, I am ok with that but some of my friends who are hardcore pickle lovers would have problem with no salt pickles.   The hand-cut fries was perfect though - neither too thin, nor thick. So it was nice and crunchy outside and moist inside.   Overall, I like what I see. Yes, they are still setting things up. Currently there is lot of empty spaces, beer on tap missing and so on. But that's what the soft opening is for - to get feedbacks and make sure everything right before grand opening.\",\n",
       " 'I have no shame in admitting I am a Red Robin fan. Have been for almost 20 years, in fact, ever since high school, when cadets from the nearby Air Force Academy would try to flirt with me and my friends by sending us over pitchers of water (since none of us were old enough to drink. Clever the first time, but after that--couldn\\'t they at least send a pitcher of Diet Coke? Or maybe one of those delicious Mountain High Mud Pies?). I pretty much always get the Clucks & Fries, a cuter name for chicken strips. So yummy. Occasionally I get the Crispy Chicken Burger--aka, Clucks & bread--but that\\'s only when I\\'m feeling crazy.  Yes, this is a family-friendly joint. If you don\\'t like that environment, you probably won\\'t like Red Robin. But the food is solid. How can you not love bottomless fries? And steak fries at that? If you deny it, I won\\'t believe you.  Now, in terms of this particular location--I had an unfortunate experience a couple of months ago with my waiter. I put down $30 on a $21 bill. He took the bill and left...and never returned. I waited. And waited. And waited. I thought about leaving because I\\'m kind of passive that way, but my friend reminded me that it was ridiculous to leave a $9 tip on a $21 bill. So I waited some more. He never came over to check on us. I mean, usually, even if you\\'ve already paid and you\\'re just hanging out talking, your waiter will come by and refill your water, you know? Not this guy. He disappeared into oblivion. Eventually, I had to stop someone else and ask her to get our waiter for us. Then, when he finally showed up and I told him I needed change, he said, \"Oh! I already closed you guys out,\" and hesitated like I\\'d say, \"Never mind then.\" But I didn\\'t, so he relunctantly got my change.  I disliked that experience. Intensely. It made me uncomfortable. It made me feel like I was being cheap. I have to take a star away from my review for that, as sad as it makes me.   Nonetheless, I\\'ll keep going back.

       " \"Excited to pick up a take-out lunch?  Yes, odd, but true.  In a world where lunch is but a brief respite from work, quickly picked-up or reheated and just as quickly downed in order to get back to work, I was excited for this little trip in my mid-day because I had just recently discovered that Gene's Chinese Flatbread Cafe's location in Boston had finally opened, and within lunchtime walking distance!  The well touted original is all the way out in Chelmsford - but just when am I going to be all the way out there?!  Yes, not very likely.  Gene's is a small establishment - brickwork and drink-fridge lined - with a window counter/open kitchen lined with faux brick against the back where you order and can observe the kitchen workers cooking away, and sometimes hand pulling those noodles.  There were perhaps 8-10 tables as well as a counter with seats by the window - not too shabby for high rent Boston.  But there wasn't really anywhere to wait for take-out without being in each other's way.  Located right beside the also relatively new Vietnamese SA PA, it is like we have our own mini Chinatown within easier lunching distance of Downtown Crossing!  From ordering at the cashier to having my bagged food in hand - about 10 minutes.  Just listen up for your number.  The see through partition between the kitchen and the public tends to muffle the noise here.  Plasticware, chopsticks and napkins are set off to the side - be sure to pick some up as they do not provide them with your food.  It is self-service here.  My #3 Pork Flatbread Sandwich ($4 for 1; the picture on the menu is just a tad deceiving) was a bit oily - not sure if that was due to the moist mass of shredded pork (neither too dry nor too moist) or what.  The bread was a bit tough - not the soft steamed buns that I've been enjoying lately at other businesses - but hey, it isn't called flatbread (and not bao) for nothing.  One's a snack - a meal it isn't.  But I also had my order of #9 Cumin lamb hand-pulled noodles $8.40.  Chewy wide glistening orange oil tinged (yeah, that's the source of the spice) noodles, flavorful tender slices of lamb (but watch out for the few tougher bits), thick onion pieces (the sweet sort!).  Yes, this was a meal.  My tongue and lips tingled - I could handle it, but I'll see if they can do a mild or non-spicy version next time.  I also realized what the simple beansprouts and cilantro (perhaps the onions too) were there for - unflavored and basic and boring looking - they were there to cut the heat!  CASH ONLY!  Don't be that fella, all ready with his credit card to pick up the bill, whose lady friend and her wallet has to come to the rescue of.  (Yes, that really did happen.)  Just FYI - they rounded me up to the next decile, so no pennies change hands here, I guess!  *** 2/2014 ***  One big bonus they have for the winter patron - a solid wooden inner door!!!  Having recently been subjected to a blast of chilly air every time the door opened during lunch at another local establishment, I'll vouch for the blessing this is.  And I hope you can handle some spice in your food - my #9 came with a kick even though I asked for it to be not spicy.  PS - their Boston menu offerings have grown since last summer with the addition of two $11 dishes: #2 Lamb Hand-pulled Noodle Soup, and #7 Lamb Stew, although the latter is offered only after 2pm.  PPS - they don't accept orders over the phone, so get your butt out there and place your order in person.  *** 7/2015 ***  Okay, the wooden inner door is now thick strips of hanging plastic - but does the job (note, I'm saying this in the summer time).  I tried again with the #9 Cumin lamb hand-pulled noodles $8.40 non-spicy version.  It was explained to me that the lamb marinade is already somewhat spicy, so the dish couldn't be made 100% non-spicy.  The dish that arrived however was missing the glistening redness of the past - so, score!  The portion was generous, and I took the rest of the dish back with me for another meal.\",\n",

In fact, the whole area is decorated like a winter wonderland. Disney is full of magic and this is one of the things they do well.   I'm always advising friends to stop here on there holiday trips and they are always amazed at what they see. They are also grateful for this insider tip. So I am glad that someone put this up on Yelp.  It is now going to get even more crowded then it already was. I can feel the Yelpers bookmarking it right now.   The Grand Floridian Hotel is packed during the holiday because everyone is stopping here. You can get here by monorail which is the easiest. One year I drove over and it was a nightmare. I was lucky enough to get a spot but it was stressful. I would hate to be paying $400 a night and have to deal with all these tourists crammed in my lobby especially because 95% aren't even staying here.   Make sure you bring some money too because it would not be Disney unless they were selling stuff.  Pick up a Christmas tree ornament to remember the occasion because you'll never know when you'll come back. Don't forget your camera too because the photos will be magical.  Leave it to Disney to turn a simple oversized Gingerbread House into a main attraction. Loyal holiday seekers have been viewing this spectacle since 1999. I can't wait for the day when one lucky person can rent this out and sleep in it. It's Disney in high season and with rooms a commodity I'm sure they will figure out a way. Bottom line is don't miss this attraction. Put it on your list because this is pure Disney magic at its best.\",\n",

       " \"This place is DISGUSTING and completely unhygienic.  I decided to try this place after driving by a few times and seeing the ad in the window for 10% off for life and 25 mani and pedi. When I went in, the owner Kim told me that the special had just ended and when I questioned why they still had the sign up he agreed to do it for 25. I got a pedicure which was so/so and then needed my gels taken off and wanted a manicure afterwards. The girl that did my nails had no idea what she was doing. She didnt take my fake gels off all the way so after she painted them and I left they peeled off and so did my manicure. i went back the following day to have them fix this. They seemed aggravated that they had to correct this but once they started soaking my nails off and saw that I was right, their mood changed. I would've gone back after this until I saw this...  THEY (and I am not lying in one bit) TOOK THE ACETONE THAT I HAD SOAKED MY NAILS IN AND USED A PLASTIC FUNNEL TO POUR IT BACK INTO THE ACETONE BOTTLE WHEN I WAS WASHING MY HANDS. Thats just gross. I feel sorry for the person that had to use that after me, and am disgusted to think whose hands, cuticle, skin and nails where in the acetone that i had been soaking my nails in. I will never go back here. They might be trying to make it seem upscale and classy since they just opened but they are not clean and I am sure that it will only get worse!!  *Keim- I appreciate your response, however I find that I need to clarify a few thing about my review..  1- The acetone that was already used was not poured into a plastic bottle for disposal that I could tell, because I WATCHED the nail tech pour into the bottle from which it came from. It seems like somewhat of a tideous task to pour only the contents you need from one bottle to another, and then back into the same bottle only to be poured into a seperate disposal bottle?   2- As a hair stylist myself, and as you should know from being in the industry, just because someone has been working for several years by no means that they are good at what the do. Experience helps, but that doesnt mean that someone has the talent to back it up.  and 3- as far as a refund goes, you were there when I came in, and at no time was any refund offered to me You corrected the service which I mentioned but nothing was given back to me.   And finally it is funny you say that your 10% deal was for the first 200 customers because when I came in you said that it had ended last Thursday and if this is the case you should take the sign out of your window.  People- you may make your own opinions on this business, but it is not like me to write a negative review about any business unless I feel very strongly about it,and this is one of those times. Save your money and time, go across the street to BB nails where Tony and his team will take care of you. IT might not be as PRETTY, but there are no sales gimicks, tricks, or reused acetone.\",\n",

I still can't decide whether the clothes make the girls more sexy or whether the fact that really really sexy girls wear them is what makes the clothes really sexy.  The worst thing about them are the insane prices. The other bad thing about them is the fact that they use extremely skinny models and almost no models with actual curves.

       " 'I lived in Atlanta for 3 years and never knew that Il Localino existed.... and I am super bummed about that, because it is AWESOME!  My friends who still live in ATL discovered the restaurant and go all the time, so we came here with a group of 12 girls on the Friday night of my bachelorette party weekend for dinner and drinks.  I literally couldn\\'t think of a more fun restaurant atmosphere and am so grateful for this place!  The restaurant is small and cozy, and looks like your standard authentic Italian restaurant.... if that restaurant was drunk (and I mean that in the best way!)  Everything glows red because of the rope lights everywhere, and there is SO MUCH TO LOOK AT!  Framed pictures and posters and signs and paper lanterns and chairs hanging from the ceiling....  And there are racks of hats throughout the restaurant that you can not only borrow to wear during dinner, but are seemingly encouraged to!  Everyone in my party borrowed a fun hat - mine was a sequined cowboy hat with a rhinestone tiara on top!  They play their music pretty loudly, and it\\'s upbeat and fun.  The disco ball will randomly start spinning and when you least expect it the fog machine will go off.  And in the back room where we were sitting all of this organized chaos was offset by a large TV screen showing scenic and peaceful views of Italy.    The food itself was average at best.  I started with the fried calamari appetizer and it was okay, but tasted a bit under seasoned.  For my entrée I got the \"classical rendition\" fettuccini alfredo, which was also just fair.  The noodles tasted homemade, but the sauce was also under seasoned and very oily.  Also, this place isn\\'t necessarily cheap for the food they\\'re serving - the fettuccini was $22.95.  But I think you honestly pay for the atmosphere and good vibes there, and that\\'s why I\\'m giving this place 4 stars instead of 2 or 3.  That food for that price would have been disappointing if I wasn\\'t having such a blast in such a fun place with my friends!  The restaurant also gave us all complimentary limoncello shots in honor of my bachelorette weekend, which was delicious and so very nice of them!  The bottle of limoncello was frozen in a bucket with a bunch of lemons, which makes for a pretty neat presentation (though it probably doesn\\'t make it the easiest to pour).  Basically, this was the perfect spot for this weekend and we all really enjoyed ourselves.  They welcomed us with open arms and made sure we had fun!  Sure the food isn\\'t the best ever, but really Atlanta isn\\'t even known for having amazing Italian food so this should be no shock.

They're also very honest and will not tell you that you need additional things if you really don't.  I've gotten checked up here twice and both times they told me that I have no cavities and that my teeth are perfect and to keep up the good work.  So, I trust them, they are quick and efficient, they are courteous, and they are effective.    The only critiques I have with them are that the tooth that was fixed the first time needed to be replaced soon because of grinding and/or because of the job they did.  Either way, they either did a bad job the first time or weren't trained enough to identify and prevent my grinding.  Either way, they are honest and definitely competent overall.\",\n",
       " 'Chanterelle\\'s describes itself as \"soul food with a french cuisine spin\" Ok so I lived in Atlanta..nearly 5 mins from this place and i NEVER knew it existed. However I had \"heard\" that they had some good food. Now if  your going to judge it on looks they get a \"0\" because it looks horrible from the outside....but once you go in.....you smell the wonderful aromas of all the food.   The food is served cafeteria style...They have tons of choices...just to make ur mouth water i\\'ll tell you a few....rosemary chicken, barbecue chicken, flounder, and vegetables.....they have potatoes, rice pilaf, squash, zucchini, cabbage, but everything is seasoned perfectly and very tasty. Oh and they have this wonderful, fresh, homemade lemonade....u HAVE to get that! Its a bit on the pricey side. I bought the rosemary chicken with potatoes, cornbread and a lemonade for 9.50 whew!  Although they have this one cashier...she is just not friendly...i mean she has not smiled once and i\\'ve been going there for a year. I really wish they would replace her with someone a lil happier!  Definitely if your in the area you should give this place a try. They have parking on the street and some reserved parking in the Krispy Kreme parking lot.',\n",
       " 'The following review is rated \"R\", due to strong language and partial nudity.   I\\'m usually careful about watching my language when in crowded restaurants, but my filter completely disappeared when I ate here.   Let\\'s back-step for a second...French Quarter Grille is in a shopping center anchored by Wallymart. It\\'s the former location of Mama Roux\\'s (whose premature departure is still saddening) and is unassuming and easy to miss. Missing it would be a mistake. Opening the door and crossing the threshold transports you into a casual fine dining atmosphere, full of ambiance and warmth. From the moment you walk in, you are greeted warmly and genuinely. After being seated, we were quickly attended to by a friendly waitress. A quick rundown of the nightly specials was where my filter began its dissolution. The special app was a crawfish cheesecake. Yeah, I just used those words together...Creamy custardy (is that a word?) savory cheesecake with crawfish tails dispersed throughout, smothered in a rich creamy crawfish sauce. Just the right amount of heat and a mouthful of flavor...served with toast points. I could have easily made a meal out of 4-6 of these. The server returned to ask how it was...my reply...\"This shit is fucking gooood!\" Forgetting of course I was sitting in a full dining room with my visiting senior parents. It was fully warranted! Momma went with a bowl of gumbo. Now, calling it a bowl is misleading. Trough would be a better description. A plethora of crawfish, vegetables, and sausage swimming in an aromatic dark roux broth. Full of flavor and sustenance, this was a winner. Poppa had the Peppered Pork Tenderloin. Jumbo tenderloin grilled and served with mango pineapple chutney. It was served perfectly med-rare as requested. Although, I\\'m not a fan of fruit in my food, it had a great balance of sweet and savory. Dad was pleased. As for me...I chose the Catfish Gumbo.Blackened filet over dirty rice topped with shrimp and crawfish gumbo. I\\'m not typically a catfish fan, but shit, son! This was amazing! The dirty rice was made properly with chicken livers and plenty of butter. In my mind, I was calculating how many trips to the gym I would need because of this meal, but I didn\\'t care.   Now, I make frequent trips to the Big Easy for the fun and particularly the food. I haven\\'t had occasion to make the trip lately to get my fix, but thankfully French Quarter Grille is here to fill the void.  ...oh wait! I promised partial nudity, didn\\'t I?! I wanted to rub the dirty rice all over my exposed chest and massage the gumbo on my quivering...we\\'ll stop there before this turns \"NC-17\".',\n",
       " 'After more than a few months of long-terms stays at the Sutton Place Hotel in downtown Vancouver, my lovely boyfriend had racked up enough points to send me and my nagging back problems to the Vida Wellness Spa, located in the hotel.  This was my first visit, but not my last and certainly not the most memorable of the two...in the best way possible of course.   I arrived the recommended 15 minutes early and was escorted by a pleasant staff member to the soft-lit, spacious change rooms.  Vida spa users are also allowed use of the pool, gym and steam rooms, all located on the same level.  Delicious smelling amenities, hair care, lotions and the like were all provided, as well as luxurious white robes and slippers to throw on with abandon before heading to your treatment.    While filling out the obligatory health form, I sipped on complimentary Ayurvedic tea and contemplated gaining more knowledge in the 5000 year old holistic health tradition of India, known as Ayurveda, the foundation behind Vida\\'s techniques and treatments.  Now I won\\'t get into the details of the treatment this time around, as mentioned, this was my first visit.  I had a 1 hour massage that was truly heavenly and without much squirming as my back was in better shape than usual.  I vowed to return to the spa with my boyfriend who had never received a massage by a professional.  The second time around was our 1st year anniversary and cause for celebration and relaxation, a perfect opportunity for a couples massage at Vida.  The service was again, impeccable, warm and welcoming.  My boyfriend and I were situated in the same large room, massage tables apart just enough that we couldn\\'t disturb each other\\'s experience.  I was going to be massaged by a male and my boyfriend, a female; this can be adjusted to your comfort level by calling ahead.    The room was dim and smelt wonderful, of flowers and herbs and total bliss!  This feeling lasted until the massage began, at the base of my neck which was apparently, the origin of the pain in my back.  My masseuse asked me quietly if I had ever experienced migraines, I was shocked as I had, just recently been victim to these strange and debilitating headaches for the first time in my life.   His perceptiveness continued as he worked his way down, the pain becoming so severe in my lower back that he decided to stay in that area for the duration of the massage.    I glanced over to see my boyfriend catatonic and lazily unaware of what was happening on the other side of the room.  By this time I am being contorted and massaged to the point where my eyes are watering and the agony is so apparent that I almost begin to laugh at how absurdly hilarious this is.  I am hoping that my masseuse will tell me that \"I am not the only one...etc etc\".  Instead, he tells me that he is incredibly surprised that someone so young could have such back problems and not even know it.  Great.    Although it may have sounded like a torture chamber in there, my masseuse and his vast knowledge proved to be miraculous for my encumbered back.  He provided a page of stretches and exercises that I could do to improve my mobility and strength, and ideas on how to become more aware of my body so as to avoid having to endure another minute of pain.  It was a blessing in disguise and one I will not soon forget.  The kindness and thought paid to me was more than I had experienced at other spas and this attention to detail (never mind the beautiful spa in itself) will keep me coming back again and again.  Oh and my boyfriend did actually fall asleep while having his massage done, if that isn\\'t testament enough to Vida\\'s genius.',\n",
       " \"We have come here twice by pleasant accident. We originally headed to the area for sushi, but the sushi place is closed on Sunday. Right next door is Thai Five so we wandered in, once, twice, and will do it again intentionally next time. The service was very kind and attentive. The food is reasonably priced, freshly prepared and as good as any Thai food I've had anywhere else. We have only been here on the weekend, right when they open, and it wasn't very busy. I hope, for their sake and mine, that people discover this place and satisfy their Thai cravings here.\",\n",
       " \"So we had well over an hour before our little table for two would be ready at the ridiculously popular Pok Pok down the block. Meanwhile, our biggest meal up to that point on that special first day in Portland was taking individual bites of four yeast-raised monstrosities at Voodoo Doughnuts, so it would be appropriate to describe Jamie W. and me as feeling peckish anticipating our upcoming green papaya salad. When we passed by this trendy yet spacious shop, we were naturally intrigued. There was a polar bear in a ski cap and ice cream pop art on the wall (photo: http://bit.ly/2ujpQ7l).  They had chocolate and vanilla, but of course, it had to be Valrhona Chocolate and Madagascar Vanilla. What was more intriguing to us were the two non-dairy froyo options that were apparently made from almond milk. Something sweet before dinner couldn't hurt, right? Jamie went for the Hazelnut Praline which for a small $3.95 cup, was a generously tall serving (photo: http://bit.ly/2KKa1BF). That meant I had to get a small cup of the Vanilla Latte which plopped over in pure exhaustion from the spigot (photo: http://bit.ly/2KVvBTc). Refreshing and not too sweet. It was the perfect unintended appetizer on such an eventful Portland day.  FROYO - 4 stars...smooth dairy-free froyo worth seeking out AMBIANCE - 4 stars...stylish spot that manages to be kid-friendly  SERVICE - 4 stars...she was generous with the spigots TOTAL - 4 stars...froyo appetizers make sense to me\",\n",
       " \"I was a little worried at first that I'd suggested this for a ladies' lunch because one of our friends is a vegetarian and cajun food pretty much equals meat or meat fat (not a bad thing in my book).  Of course I didn't remember this until about an hour before our time to meet. Between vegetarians and nut allergies there's a potential for any restaurant choice to either poison my friends or insult their ideologies.  Thankfully I have forgiving friends who remember to take their benadryl.  We asked the server if she could offer any options for our beloved vegetarian and she said she'd see what they could do.  The chef rose to the challenge with a gorgeous fettuccine with mushroom alfredo sauce, crowned with a stack of grilled asparagus, then ringed with fried green tomatoes.  It was a beautiful sight and even made me rethink my red beans and rice with roasted pork, which was smoky and really nice.  We shared the crawfish beignets, fried green tomatoes, and fried crawfish.  The beignets were pretty much hush puppies with crawfish tails in them and were just sort of ok to me.  The fried crawfish were good, I really enjoyed the remoulade that came with that.    The highlight really were the fried green tomatoes - they were crisp on the outside and fresh on the inside topped with an unbelievable crabmeat remoulade.  Several of us agreed we'd be happy to just have a bowl of that crabmeat.  The server was pleasant and attentive, the water and iced tea were consistently refilled.  The owner was a really entertaining gem - he made sure we were happy and was incredibly nice and fun to talk to.  I didn't find that I was underdressed in jeans but it was lunchtime and I'm kind of bad at noticing that kind of thing.    I converted several friends to Yelp by telling them about the 15% off yelp offer if they checked in - so keep an eye out for new blood.  Two of us took full advantage of the 50% off wine under 40 dollars on Wednesdays and Thursdays by sharing a bottle of red over lunch.    Yes I had a nice buzz on at lunch don't judge me I was in the French Quarter.\",\n",
       " 'Really REAL Vintage...!?!  When I was younger I used to equate the term \"vintage\" with old, un-stylish, sometimes mothball-smelling, second hand throwaways. I was after all, a child of the 80\\'s and honestly, whose parent\\'s didn\\'t do vintage...!?! It took a very close, and very highly regarded label-loving girlfriend of mine, (who is single-handedly responsible for introducing me to the world of Prada, Burberry and moderns like Tory Birch) to re-open my eyes to this wonderful world. And how amazing the world of Vintage can be!   Enter Encore Fashion Boutique. This little gem doesn\\'t appear to be an out-of-the-ordinary vintage store at first glance. When I visited it this weekend it had a bit of a run-down appearance, a basket of children\\'s toys outside, and windows full of sparkly jewelry, some real and some not-so-real but eye catch and pretty. Being a new member to the vintage-loving cult, and naked without my fashionable confidante, it took me a second or two to compose myself and summon the courage to enter. I didn\\'t take much convincing though, as it was suddenly clear that what lay just inside this camouflaged facade was better than anything anyone could have told me. With the ting of the doorbell I was immersed in Gucci, Coach, Kate Spade, Caroline Herrera, Diane Von Furstenberg and Manolo. Wow. These names did take a little coaxing from the racks of garments and piles of shoes, but I was more than delighted with all of my finds. Not only was I discovering discarded Versace but it was on sale from the discounted price too. 40% off the Vintage tag to be exact. And then it happened... the find of all finds - and TWO of them to be precise. I couldn\\'t believe it as I pulled from the rack an in-perfect-condition Max Mara woolen black skirt. Followed by a grey pleated Dolce and Gabbana knee length wonder. And both, yes both, were on sale from $198 and $149 to $20. Yes, real Dolce and Max for just $20. I MUST have done something right! On top of these finds, I also discovered a Valetino cocktail dress that still had its tags on, that had gone from 349 Euros to $189 and was now 40% off. Unfortunately not the perfect fit for my body, but I\\'ve put the word out so imagine it will go quickly.   Vintage, REAL Vintage, and at real Vintage prices too - something you don\\'t find a lot of in Vancouver\\'s Vintage specialty stores. This store is not half as picked-over as many of the other Vintage shops seem to be in and around this city. This little gem would never have enticed me if I was just passing by, but boy, this Vintage store must be the find of the century!',\n",
       " 'This place is just awful.  I set up an appointment ahead of time.  I walked in a couple of minutes early.  I waited about 20 minutes.  When I say waited, I do not mean waited in a waiting room, I waited in an Indian clothing store.  I was then told to go into this other room which generally did not appear clean.  I sat in a barbers chair with no neck support and was instructed to lean my head back and she began.  During my threading experience, the woman took off too much of my eyebrows without my consent and then went over one area so many times that not only did it hurt but it also left a cut on my face.  within 12 hours of leaving this place, I broke out worse than I had ever experienced.  I blame this solely on one major discovery I made while in the chair:  I looked up during the threading process and saw the woman holding the thread in her mouth!!!  I never break out from threading and must assume that the bacteria from her mouth had much to do with this unpleasant side-effect that lasted a solid two weeks!  The only positive thing I can say about this place is that it is incredibly cheap.  Caveat emptor!!!',\n",

Dr. Meyer is now my chosen physician and she is the best! Always so personable and has a fantastic memory about anything non-health related as well! A great and nice personal touch.  The staff is always willing to make and schedule an appointment if it's an emergency. The best is you can book online.  Oh and the cherry on top is the office is amazingly clean and relaxed.

Winnie was professional and so friendly, did not rush me out after, and made sure my nails were completely dry before leaving.

Sometimes with big promotions you discover a place you\\'d go to regardless; other times it\\'s clear why they have to resort to such tactics to get anyone in the door. Sadly, this is one of those times.  The woman who saw me was terribly abrasive in her manner. I had to repeatedly decline the upselling for their facials and products and she went so far as to reenter the room just to loudly disturb my \"relaxing\" portion of the wrap (my eyes were closed) to ask me again--after I\\'d already politely declined numerous times!   I\\'ve experienced many a massage and wrap and this was by far the worst: 1-star technique, attentiveness, and attitude. The facilities are also nothing special and I was not even offered a towel and had to ask for it after my shower. I also told her to be careful about a big cut on my knee, but she dismissively nodded and proceeded to scrape across this area anyway! I also was never offered anything to drink for the nearly 2 hours I was there, and had to ask for that too.   Bottom line: dismissive, pushy, sloppy, and unprofessional. DO NOT RECOMMEND!',\n",
       " 'After my bad experience, the office manager called me and told me that they would not fix the carpet they messed up, despite saying they would on here and over the phone because of my yelp review. She actually said that. I\\'m no Yelp expert, but that seems like it should be against some guideline. If I hadn\\'t been honest about my experience on here, my carpet would have been fixed by Peace Frog.   When I reminded her about the 200% guarantee prominently displayed on their website, she said I needed to make an appointment with another cleaner and someone from peace frog would discuss the damage with the new company. In other words, I needed to jump through a bunch of hoops and take more of my time to get them to honor their guarantee and fix the carpet that they made stink. Still, I wanted it fixed so made an appointment with a new company. And I tried calling peace frog back to tell them when the appointment with the new cleaner was, but they conveniently did not answer or return my calls.  Then, the owner showed up at my house with a refund check without any warning or prior notice. I was alone with two small kids asleep in the house and having this angry guy just appear at my door (He was also upset also about my yelp review) was startling. He seemed to think the refund, while genuinely appreciated, would finish things, but they don\\'t just advertise a refund, they say 200%, and my carpet was still stinking, so I told him when my appointment with the new cleaner was. While standing on my doorstep, he refused to come in and look at (or more importantly smell) the damaged carpet just a few feet away.   When I asked if he would pay for someone else to fix it, as the office manager suggested, he told me no, adding that if I had a problem with that answer, I could write about it on Yelp. Very clever, very unprofessional. But a helpful suggestion none the less.   So now I am. My experience indicated that Peace Frog\\'s \"200% Peace of Mind Promise,\" if it actually exists, could use an Astrix by it saying something like *\"only if you promise to not talk about how we screwed up on Yelp.\" In the end, I was left worse off than when I started, having to fix a problem that didn\\'t exist before they came to my house. The only upside is that this experience led me to another carpet cleaner in town that does reasonably priced, quality work.',\n",

       " \"I had been itching to get tattooed by Mulysa Mayhem for some time, because., well, just look at her work - it speaks for itself.  The quality is outstanding and the details in each and every piece are immaculate.    Although I had originally chosen another artist to do my phoenix, it was important to me that whoever did it understood the personal and symbolic significance behind the tattoo.  Thanks to the universe, Mulysa and I randomly crossed paths while out and about one day, and she agreed to do the tattoo of my dreams - a phoenix rising out of fire and ashes.  With Mulysa being extremely knowledgable of anything/everything magickal, no one is better suited for this project than her.      Less than a month later, I was in the shop for a consult (which Mulysa came in on her day off to meet me), then shortly after, given a list of scheduled appointments to get the process going!  Before I knew it, I was at my first appointment for the outline, and so began the birth of my phoenix.  I'm on my 5th session of the piece, and it exceeds my expectations.  I only showed Mulysa a few pictures of reference material and answered a few of her questions regarding what I wanted, and the phoenix is beyond my wildest dreams.  It's crazy how she was able to take my vision and make it a perfect masterpiece to adorn my body.  The placement on my body flatters my curves, and the red, yellow, and orange pigments of ink compliment the white of my pale skin perfectly.     Without Mulysa's talent, dedication, and undying commitment to making this tattoo the best possible, it wouldn't be what it is.  Having the phoenix on me for life empowers me, and brings out an inner strength I didn't know existed in me prior.  Getting work done at Good Mojo really is like having a spell casted in your skin!  I have a ways to go with my phoenix, but I'm extremely happy with the progress of it so far.  While I can't wait 'till it's finished, I'm enjoying each and every one of my sessions with Mulysa, because they are always full of good laughs, meaningful conversation, and all around awesomeness!    I will be going back to Mulysa for other work, as well as Inkwitch Lisa, Tara, and Carly.  You won't find a better tattoo shop that has both top-notch work and amazing people anywhere else.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve been to five classes (three at the Watertown location and two at the W. Roxbury site) after purchasing a great deal on Groupon ($49 for 10 classes at either location for new clients or those who haven\\'t been in 6 months). Recently, Groupons are seemingly for businesses that can\\'t get customers in the door due to poor quality goods or services, as opposed to businesses that are new or are in a not-so-ideal location. Inner Strength needs Groupon because its prices are exorbitant, but it houses high quality instructors and a decent facility. Still, I can\\'t say that the prices are reasonable because I\\'m a regular at a studio located in Boston with more amenities, exceptional instructors, and less expensive prices. So, I think Inner Strength really should consider lowering its prices across the board. $17 for a drop-in is crazy. And it\\'s barely a deal to buy a 10 class card with a six month expiration for $150.    Other notes: The floors in both locations are insanely hard. It feels like there is concrete underneath the wood floors. You don\\'t notice it after about 15 minutes or so into class because there are so many standing postures in these classes, but it\\'s rather uncomfortable as you\\'re waiting for class to start or during savasana.   The individual class descriptions do not note heat, but they should because almost all of the classes are HEATED! I\\'m talking 100+degree heat. There is only one line on the website that says they are heated, which I did not see before I went so I was dying my first class. You will need a towel and lots of water. The peak time classes (5pm or later) are usually packed, which makes the heat even more unbearable. Your clothes will be soaking wet when you leave.   Every class I\\'ve taken started at least 5 minutes late, but some even 10-15 minutes late! What gives? They then end about 5-10 minutes late which balances it out, but I wish they would start/end on time.   There is a definite dogma here: there are things you SHOULD be doing in your life, one of them being extremely hot, challenging yoga. I feel that some of the instructors get on their soapboxes and lecture (or borderline scold) about coming to power yoga regularly if you want to get better. I feel these comments are unnecessary in a yoga class. I like the \"you did something great for yourself today by coming to yoga so be grateful for this moment\" approach much better, and find that feeling of gratitude is what keeps me coming back for more.  Most of the classes have all the same structure without a lot of variations amongst teachers. You can tell that they all either received their training from Inner Strength or are following the dogma of the studio. All of the instructors are nice, understanding and don\\'t force you to do anything (each one has offered child\\'s pose) but you can tell that there are high expectations.  I gave 4 stars because even though power/hot yoga is not my thing, the instructors are highly knowledgable, the facility is clean, parking is manageable at each location and they have various times for class offerings.',\n",

They have four different gin and tonics (all using different gin and tonics, sourced locally and from abroad), and four different gin cocktails.  I tried three different gin and tonics and they were all pretty solid. If I had to rank I would go with Juniper (citrus tonic with Juniper berries), cucumber gin and tonic, and finally the rad-ish. The same can't be said about the garden smash gin cocktail. It's a gin/mezcal drink and it tasted like straight Mezcal... and I'm not a huge fan of Mezcal. Perhaps if you're a fan of Mezcal or tequila you'll love it.  I was told that within two months the gin and tonic section will be quadrupling! Wowza!   They had a pretty solid craft beer selection as well. I spotted a bunch of local favourites - four winds, steel and oak, strange fellows, dageraad, and a few others.   The drink list was curated by Vancouver's very own Shaun Layton (former head bartender at L'Abbatoire) so I'm sure you can't go wrong with any drink you order.  Drinks were a bit on the pricey side - most gin and tonics average around $13 but it's understandable given the quality of gin and tonics they use.\",\n",

       " \"THEY STOLE OUR FOOD, LITERALLY!  I don't know what to say, this was the plot for a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode but it happened to us the other day at Amrhein's.  We were celebrating my dad's birthday and went out to eat a family meal.  My brother ordered the Lobster Mac n Cheese and went with a full order (this cost $24).  One thing you have to understand about my brother is that he is built like a stick, he decided to get the full order because he could bring the leftovers home with him.  So the end of the meal rolls around and both myself and him decided to take the rest of our food back.  I ordered the Pumpkin Risotto and also had a fair amount left on the plate.  We ask the waitress to pack our leftovers and she comes back with a plastic bag containing the leftovers in two boxes.  We never opened the leftovers at the restaurant to check, I mean why would we?  I guess we were naive to assume that the restaurant would give us the food we paid for.  We came home and decided to put the food away in the fridge.  That's when we noticed that the box containing my brothers food was tiny, compared to mine.  This was despite the fact that his portion was much larger and he barely ate a quarter of it.  It was at that point we realized that  either the waiter or the kitchen staff had basically taken my brothers leftovers for themselves and put a skimpy serving in a small take out box.  I hope this is clear.  THEY TOOK OUR LEFTOVERS FOR THEMSELVES!  WHO DOES THAT?  We are joking about how this plot mirrored a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode and then we decided to go on Yelp and see if anyone else had a similar experience.  I have not read a review like this yet, but there are plenty of 1-2 star ratings, we ended up learning about other shady practices such as not honoring vouchers and not giving customers back exact change (i.e. rounding off totals for themselves).  To be honest I don't think the whole thing about the change is that big a deal, but when I compared that to the experience we just had I couldn't believe that this restaurant continues to be in operation.  Basically Amrheins was the most screwed up eating experience I've ever had.  I'm looking forward to telling EVERYONE about what happened to us.\",\n",

I ordered the Caesar with anchovies and the burrata to start, and followed it up with the Cacio e Pepe Pizza.  Needless to say everything I tried was DELICIOUS and very well made, including the Grey Lady which is a local Belgian style wit beer.   After dinner we took a quick walk over to Mike's pastry for a slice of ricotta pie, which I would highly recommend, but if  that's not your thing then a canola should do the trick.  Either way its a 5 minute walk and well worth your trouble.\",\n",

       " \"I absolutely love Lifetime. I've been a member at this gym for 3 years now and though I wouldn't label myself a 'gym rat', some of my friends would disagree. I do workout 5-6 times a week. When you spend a lot of time in the gym there are somethings you can't compromise. Cleanliness, space, amenities for children and professionalism of the staff are the biggest things for me.  Having been a member at LA Fitness previously I will say I won't ever go back to a gym that is a turnstile for employees and members. Lack of tenure and consistency is always a sign of a poorly managed gym or company.  Lifetime is always clean, and has a great staff that keeps the gym that way! The amount of equipment and space is great. I never feel that I have to wait for something endlessly. And they have great programs for adults and children, including karate, swimming, squash, basketball and an array of group fitness classes. I love love love the child's center. Private basketball court and indoor/outdoor play area for the kids. Plus a media area equipped with iPads and iMacs, plus a separate room for infants and a tv area with games and toys! Those of you who have kids and go to LA fitness know this is a huge step up from the single room with a 20in tv and an old school McDonald's style playplace, lol.  If you're thinking to sign up but are worried about the pricing, I highly suggest you at least try it out on a guest pass or trial. It's well worth the money in comparison to other gyms. The sales staff is super friendly and accommodating. Go see Micah, Caroline, Nick or Sergio!\",\n",
       " \"Finally did it! Been telling myself to try Habesha for years but I kept driving past it. Not anymore.  Habesha is a nice break from all the pizza and Chinese a Maldonian is accustomed to in his or her lifetime. There are about a single handful of restaurants in the Greater Boston Area where one can feast on authentic Ethiopian dishes and I couldn't find the time to venture into the city for a quick meal. Habesha was perfect.  I recommend trying the Habesha Special Combo as a first timer to gage your palate's reaction to the rich spices found in Ethiopian cooking. Something I wasn't prepared for when trying this cuisine for the first time was the heat, so I suggest you inquire to your server if this is a concern. The injera is a beautiful (and delicious) canvas used to scoop up mixed vegetables and stews into your mouth. It's a sour bread that's supposed to taste sour so if you're into that then great.  Because raw meat is a staple of Ethiopian food, I tried the kitifo (like steak tartare) too. Let me tell you, after having been raised all my life to cook animal meat before serving, the battle to gorge on raw ground beef was purely psychological. The warm butter and spices were appetizing but the texture is still new to me. Going to make it my mission to ease into a full raw meal someday. Until then, I'll have some more wot and honey wine please.\",\n",

       " \"NO VOLITILITY ONLY SATISFACTION AT THIS MARKET  In most culinary oriented cities, outstanding restaurants with their stellar chefs frequently reside within lavish hotels.  ATL is no different as it has many; but for some reason the perception is that these superb eateries are somewhat different and too often become an afterthought.  There is a reason why internationally renowned Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten decided to partner with Starwood Hotels and opened MARKET in the ultra-plush W Buckhead.  He knew if you took the elegance of the W, added a dash of pizzazz from interior designer extraordinaire Karim Rashid, and combine it with a relaxed unpretentious selection of foods and thirst-quenching beverages, then you have the makings of an upscale casual dining experience in a chic setting; what more can one ask for?  Chef de Cuisine David Gross (City Grill, Ritz-Carlton) deconstructs the classic recipes from Chef Jean-Georges' repertoire and adapts them to what local ingredients are available creating tasteful dishes that don't require bold spices to wow the senses.  At MARKET it's about letting the food's intrinsic flavors to take center-stage and not be compromised providing pure culinary pleasure.  A good starting point to settle in is the Living Room.  Like all get togethers, the living room is the place to get comfortable and converse. The difference with this living room is it houses a swanky bar that conjures up special cocktails that can easily wash away the hustle-bustle of the day.  The Ginger Margarita is a blend of Sauza Hornitos Reposado tequila, ginger, freshly squeezed lime with the rim salted with ginger- this drink is so refreshing and has an appealing zing about it that makes it way too easy to sink further into one of the cozy sofas.  Unlike so many restaurants that manipulate foods to extremes, at MARKET the cooking style is quite simple and straightforward achieving distinction by putting together pure foods in a way that flavors and textures are deliciously enhanced.  The Sweet Pea with Parmesan Soup is a perfect example, it takes the sweetness from local pureed peas and balances it by topping the soup with the sharp, nutty character of a parmesan cheese foam - so simple, but oh so good.  The Warm Dillwood farm's organic candy stripped beets with candied hazelnuts and seasonal herbs that's graced with a 12 year old balsamic vinegar is a perfect palate teaser.  What makes this salad so dazzling is the house-made yogurt; it brilliantly pulls together in a lush way the sweet and sour tastes of this dish. The artistically sculpted Tuna Tartare is a visual display of bright red sushi grade tuna, radiant green avocado that's finished off with a crisp radish salad, and with each bite there is a new sensation to enjoy from crunchy to creamy to down right exotic.    Now that those taste buds are screaming with joy, it's time to take them over the top.  The Beef Carpaccio and Arugula Pizza can be shared with the table and serves as intermezzo to the main entree.  After baking a thin crust with a garlic-lemon cream to perfect crispness, it's then topped with a mixture of baby arugula, ultra-thin slices of filet mignon and petite white button mushrooms with slivers of aged parmesan cheese - OMG, each mouth-watering crunch is loaded with pure bliss.  The entrée that left me speechless is the Grilled Lamb with a Mushroom Bolognese.  This otherworldly dish showcases the talent in the kitchen.  A thick Colorado lamb chop is grilled to perfection with a nice char adding more depth to the flavor of this juicy tender meat.  But, the Bolognese that lies on top of the chop is what dreams are made of, a scrumptious blend of sautéed shiitake and crimini mushrooms that's cooked down with fennel and tomatoes.  This mouth-watering carnivorous treat is served with a broccoli rabe, and to give it that special Mediterranean touch grated Pecorino is added.    Don't quit just yet, the warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake with a scoop of Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream and cocoa nib tuile is a chocoholic's dream come true, a molten warm cake made with the ultra-luxurious French chocolate that's served with a richly flavored house made ice cream that caresses the palate in ecstasy- unbelievable taste sensations.  With so much teasing and pleasing of the senses in a South Beach like setting why wait to experience all that MARKET has to offer, isn't it time to get that upscale classy feeling going again?\",\n",
       " \"Absolutely delicious! My husband and I stopped in from out of town. He saw the place on New Year's  and it was packed. We were not disappointed.   Upstairs and outside is seat yourself (at least during the time we went). We chose to sit outside. We were greeted within 2 minutes of sitting down. Everything sounded good on the menu, so I asked what would the waitress order. She suggested the Samurai Shrimp. My husband had his eye on the wing platter. Eight wings plus fries for $9 is a great deal!   The shrimp were succulent without too much sauce. They also had a nice kick to appease my spicy tooth.  Service was quick and the employees were nice. The only downside was the server brought our two plates and accidentally spilled my cole slaw on my husband's plate. He apologized profusely, and brought us out a replacement plate within a few minutes.   Overall, it was a delicious meal, great atmosphere and lovely staff.\",\n",
       " 'I don\\'t have any experience getting my nails done,  so this review comes to you from someone who had a first time bio sculpture set with extensions. It\\'s nestled upstairs in beauty mark.. Something I didn\\'t realize at first so I drove by it a couple of times.   I was greeted warmly by everybody there and was promptly seated at a station where the receptionist put down the circle of nail color options. This was new to me so I just kind of sat there awkwardly not knowing what to do.  I suppose I was meant to look at the options. I just said black.   Anyways,  my nail artist was called Faye (I\\'m pretty sure,  she kind of introduced herself abruptly). The experience was kind of awkward. I had never gotten this done before and wasn\\'t really sure what to do.  I watched. I looked at the wall a lot. I tried to make small talk but she wasn\\'t very social.   I will say though,  she was very talented. I have seen a lot of bad nails and it made me scared of them for many many years. They are beautiful. She was diligent and anal and all the things you would want out of a professional nail person. She just wasn\\'t really talkative, and then randomly said \"this might burn when we put it under the UV light\"  and didn\\'t really explain why. I was left to wonder, \\'how badly?\\',  \\'why?\\',  \\'will it harm me?\\'. It didn\\'t burn, so that\\'s good.  I asked why and she basically told me to just be glad I wasn\\'t getting gel nails. I am now afraid to try anything but bio sculpture.  Also, I must mention when I asked for extensions there was an obvious air of judgement that I don\\'t have naturally long nails. It was palpable.   Overall, they are beautiful, I am hooked. It\\'s effin\\' expensive,  especially if you like to tip well, and it\\'s awkward and smells bad, but she did a wonderful job.

We saw her 3 times, once to order the pizzas, once to check in after we were basically done with our pizza and get us one refill on drinks and then we ended up getting the hostess to get her to get our bill because we had waited so long to get her attention. She didn't make eye contact our way once the whole time and when she came for our bill she had the most condescending attitude I've ever heard.

       " \"After deciding to sell our house and move to Portland, we looked on Yelp for recommendations for a real estate agent. Of the three we interviewed, we decided on Sean. We liked how other Yelpers described him as going out of his way to get them exactly the houses they needed, even if it meant more work or smaller commissions for him. We were also impressed by his smart, relaxed, friendly personality, and his optimistic attitude towards selling our house in a slow market. He seemed like somebody we could really work with.  The market being what it was, it took us longer than we'd hoped to make a sale, and there were times when we wondered if we'd chosen our agent wisely enough. For instance, the glowing notices on Yelp were mostly from buyers - there wasn't much from people whose houses he'd helped to sell. We also wondered if he'd advised us to set our asking price too high. But he patiently helped us navigate the ups and downs of the process, and gave us plenty of good input when we needed it, with the result that we sold at a decent price within a reasonable amount of time.  Some sellers might prefer a more aggressive agent, with a snappier line of patter, but all in all, we appreciated Sean's steadiness, honesty, and persistence, and are grateful to him for helping us make a stressful experience turn out to be successful and positive.\",\n",

       " 'I\\'m jealous. Why Austin has more great food trucks and fabulous food truck parks than Houston?  I was introduced by Phillip B about his love with Stonehouse Wood Fire Grill\\'s burgers. When I first arrived in Austin, I had to stop by to check out this place. Chase, the chef, was so friendly and easy to talk to. He gave me a quick introduction about the food. I was freezing cold and I didn\\'t want to ruin my dinner with Tracey S. So, I ordered the 4\" pecan pie ($5). It was so yummy and it was not as sweet as other pies I had before.   Next day, I had The Wake-Up Call Burger. It came with a sunny-side up and the yolk created a dripping mess as I bit to it. I wanted another pecan pie, but they were sold out. I chatted with Anna, owner/operator about how I found this place on Yelp (after the address corrected). She was appreciative.   I\\'ve never been to their previous location. After I saw the photos from last biz page, I like this location at Mueller Lake Park. In combination with other food trucks, Stonehouse Wood Fire Grill makes a perfect sense for meat-hungry folks after their workout in the park. I found more seating areas besides in front of the food trucks.   It looks like I\\'ll be back to Austin more often. I bookmarked it on my GPS, I\\'ll stop at Mueller Lake Park to relax, watch the ducks and enjoy another Chase\\'s creative burger.',\n",

Since it was my first time wine tasting I was oblivious to what my first step would be. I started looking at the menu and asked her a question about a particular item on the menu and this employee interrupted me and told me to look at the menu and the description is listed on the bottom.  When this employee was giving us our wines, she didn't know the descriptions and came out with a partially filled bottle that wasn't even enough for my group (4 people).   All in all I just would want the employees to understand that not everyone is familiar with wines and customer service should be priority.

My previous oil change here, the guy drove over a curb while pulling my car around and broke my plastic hubcap (which came off and I had to go find).

I arrived late at night and the car I rented and reserved was not there. They drove it out to me the next day but that was a major pain coordinating with the driver who didn't speak English. No knock on the driver,  she was probably the shining star of this bunch but directions was not her thing.  The language barrier made it a greater challenge as trying to coordinate the next day delivery held up our day. Perhaps it was my fault for actually holding them to the terms of my reservation.  Fast forward to the end of our vacation a month or two later and I started to see Sixt rental car show up on my credit card account for small dollar amounts (a common tactic used by identity thieves to see if cards are still active).  I called to inquire but nobody knew anything and there was nothing owed on my account. The pending charges then mysteriously dropped off. Two weeks later several fraudulent charges were made against my card for hundreds of dollars, not  likely a coincidence.   I would avoid this place.

My friend and I knew 1/5 songs.   The chicken skewers smelled good, but I didn't trust them.   So, I did not enjoy this place.   Drinks were reasonable. Good prices. Good taste. But nothing amazing. That's the only reason this place even gets 2 stars. Let me tell you the rest...  Two girl fights ensued before our very eyes, and both times security let the girl who started it stay in the bar. One server even gave one of the girls a free beer, which by the way, ENDED UP ON ME. My friend told the security guard that she had threw her drink on a guy but half the drink ended up on me, the security guard didn't care. Then, while cleaning myself, I went to another security guard myself and and told him, and she was taken out.   Why is this bar allowing ANYONE associated with a fight stay in the bar? That's just plain stupid.   This place was a shit show. I don't blame the bar for the fight starting, but I blame them for allowing anyone associated with the fight stay in the bar. Unbelievable and unacceptable.   Side note, the crazy girl who threw her drink was South Asian.. One of the employees assumed she was my friend. Are we still that ignorant?

Looking around the restaurant we both remarked that it looked as if there were enough people waiting to constitute a wait of about 20 mins, max. Hoping to grab two of the stools in the bar area, we began our wait - however, we were called to our table about exactly 20 mins later. Granted, having to wait less is great, but there's something to be said for accuracy. They were telling some people after us the wait was a hour and a half, and many of those people left. Also, if we had actually assumed an hour wait and walked across the street to look in the shops in the mean time, we would have lost our spot.  The service was excellent considering how busy they were. The coffee and cheese grits were very good. I wanted to like it, and I'm sure my experience was uncommon, but my Yo Halla was extremely cold, and brimming with an almost obscene amount of cream cheese... there was far more than a conventional tub of cc in my one breakfast dish, and that's just crazy. Should have gone with the chicken and waffles I suppose.  My fiance got a combo plate with a pancake. The pancake was extra chewy and slightly doughy (like it hadn't been quite cooked through). The eggs were slightly cold. The hashbrowns, however, were pretty decent.

       " 'Argh. I just want to preface this by saying:  I\\'ve been here several times for Dim Sum (say, 5-6) and once for regular dinner service. I know it\\'s pricey for Dim Sum.   Dinner was great. It was a long time ago.. I don\\'t remember what we got exactly but it was delicious and beautifully presented. A bit more than what you\\'d normally pay at a regular Chinese joint, but the hike in price was more than represented in quality of food.  Dim Sum the next several times was lovely. A little more expensive than usual, but the exceptional Shanghai dumplings made up for it. My boyfriend and I could still be stuffed for ~$35 (including a bloody mary or two)... This time the bill was over $50 and we definitely weren\\'t nearly  so stuffed..  The last time however, something was wrong. I could hardly enjoy the food as each time we selected something from a cart and our card was marked, we were rather suspicious that we were being charged incorrectly. We got 6 dishes, and 3 of them were absolutely marked incorrectly. One was off-menu but 2 little steamed chicken buns should not be a L when comparable items (all other steam buns or chicken buns) were S or M priced dishes..  The one that really got our goat was being charged the \\'Special\\' price ($7.95) for the pork shanghai dumplings (should have just been the XL price).. We\\'ve eaten 2 orders of these every time we\\'ve been here and have tried the ones with crab (don\\'t like \\'em as much) and these were most definitely JUST pork...  So yeah. $8 for 3 little dumplings. That\\'s insane. A fourth item (shrimp won tons) was off-menu  as well and we were charged for an XL when comparable items were priced lower. $8 for 2 fried shrimp pockets. They were fantastically delicious, but damn. Not $8 worth of delicious.  I generally don\\'t hesitate to bring the bill to someone and question things if need be, but damn I just didn\\'t feel like it.. I was just so disappointed that I was feeling potentially taken advantage of by this caliber of place that I have enjoyed so much in the past. I felt totally dejected and betrayed.   I should NOT have to worry about paying the \"Stupid Tax\" here. You know, when you notice there\\'s a random $2.95 charge on your bill and when you ask someone about it they don\\'t even investigate, they just go \"Oh I\\'m so sorry! I\\'ll take it off!\". .That\\'s the stupid tax. If you\\'ve never noticed it on a bill before, you\\'ve probably paid it a few times. I\\'m generally on the lookout for it, but places definitely gain my trust and I let my guard down.  I\\'ve eaten Dim Sum  at many other places where there was no price listing to look at, and there wasn\\'t a single English word on the little tally sheets, and I\\'ve never felt cheated before. If they\\'ve changed priced, they need to fucking make note of that on the item/price listings they leave on your table. I hope they\\'re not just trying to take advantage of people\\'s ignorance and hesitance to ask questions when they\\'re sliding food onto your table if you so much as glance at it. That\\'s how dim sum works but if you\\'re not expecting it, it can be intimidating to say \"no, no!\" to get things you don\\'t want taken off your table.  I\\'m giving 3 stars in deference to the previous lovely times I\\'ve had here, and due to the possibility that 3-4 separate servers made mistakes and/or they changed their prices and failed to mark them anywhere. If the latter is the case, that\\'s just bad form in itself regardless, and this place is officially disproportionately priced.   Wow, this got long. I\\'m analyzing it like a breakup or something.

I ended up choosing a customized option that was a sofa from their online inventory with a choice of a large selection of fabrics.    The order took longer than I was told and I felt like I had to keep checking on it to get any information rather than the order department being proactive.  Once it did arrive, the coordination with the delivery team and the delivery itself was great.  I was disappointed upon delivery that my sofa included attached back pillows after I had specifically asked about these specifications and was told they were not attached.  I understand mistakes, but instead of an apology the blame was passed to me that I had gotten confused on which item we were looking at when I ordered.  I know it had been 6 wks, but when I went in to shop I knew exactly the features I was looking for so the mistake was not mine.    Overall, I am pleased with my sofa, but customer service was a bit disappointing.  I expected some small sort of compensation for the item not being to the specifications I was told it would include, but instead was told I'd get a discount on another item in the future to make up for it.

Tilapia and avocado, an excellent taco even with with Quality Seafood's offerings looming just down the street. - The Pineapple Pork. Pork carnitas and pineapple with scallions, also pretty good. - The Kim Lee BBQ. Korean BBQ pork with kimchi and scallions, on 2 toasted Hawaiian sweet rolls. This was amazing, a perfect blend of sweetness from the rolls and savory from everything else. It was like the ultimate stoner food (not a bad consideration keeping in mind the neighborhood around it, especially considering that they apparently deliver nearby until 10pm most nights. Hmm....).  Most tacos are $3.75, with the exception of the larger items like the Kim Lee, which is $5.75 and deserves every penny of its price tag. This trailer seems to prefer corn tortillas for the tacos, which is fine with me. Next time I'll probably check out the Mexican Bun Dog, which puts sausage and bacon on the Hawaiian sweet rolls, and sounds too good to pass up.\",\n",

This proved to be a most dangerous place to hide out and I walked away with a purple vinyl jacket (looks just like leather)  and a white purse.

It\\'s not that anything was over the top expensive, but sadly, I\\'m unemployed and the $15.99 I paid for both items was as far as I could stretch my dollar.

It wasn\\'t busy when I arrived with my friend, and when we walked in, there was no one at the hostess stand.

I ordered the steak and Migas Benedict and my friend ordered the crab cake Benedict. Our food was cold for the most part.

The bartender failed to even glance at us and she made herself busy acknowledging everyone else who came up to the bar and completed drink orders. If anything, it felt like she was avoiding us.

After waiting, she finally said \"I\\'ll be right with you.\"  It took her another 5 minutes to be \"right with us.\" She then proceeded to print the check without asking us if we wanted anything else, which to us made it seem like we were being kicked out, feeling even more unwelcome than before.

Menu includes rotisserie chicken and other entrees, sandwiches, salads, veggie sides, apps, and soup - we had a hard time deciding what to get because everything sounded so good. They also have quite a number of gluten-free selections. Many items are in the $10 range. I did my usual thing where I ask the cashier for her favorites to help me decide what to get.  1/4 CAROLINA CHICKEN - $10 The rotisserie chicken was moist, and came w/ jalapeno cheddar bread (good) and two sides (my favorite part the meal). There are 12 different sides and they all sounded so good - I went w/ the cashier\\'s favorites, Pickled Beets & Goat Cheese and the Creamed Spinach. The beets were perfect and together w/ goat cheese, that more perfect. And I had never seen \"pretty\" creamed spinach until today - somehow it magically retained a nice green color and had the perfect balance of fresh taste and not being overly creamy.  Also sampled my co-workers\\' sides -- the Duck Fat Fries were very good, and I really liked the Aged Cheddar Mac & Cheese. I didn\\'t get to sample the Little Gem Lettuce w/ Bleu Cheese but it looked really good and my co-worker enjoyed it. My other co-worker loved her Chicken Salad Banh Mi - she really cleaned up her plate well :)   BANOFFEE PIE - $4 I took a peek at the dessert display case and they were so tempting esp. when the cashier told me about her favorite, the Banoffee which is bananas, toffee, and cream. I gave in and loved every ingredient in the dessert - my favorite parts were actually the cream and pie crust :) Don\\'t miss out!  We\\'re definitely coming back to try the other dishes. Looking at the reviews, I\\'m intrigued by the Poutine (duck fat fries, local cheese curds, chicken gravy). I\\'m especially interested in trying the other vegetable sides.  They\\'re located in Ansley Mall next to Starbucks. Everyone is very friendly. They have outdoor seating too. You might want to get there early to avoid standing in line.  ******************* UPDATE (11/12/12)  PASTURED CHICKEN SAUSAGE & MASH - $10 The entree came w/ 3 sausage links, mashed potatoes, homemade apple sauce, and jalapeno cheddar bread.  The apple sauce was my favorite part of the meal. Mashed potatoes were good too - had some cheddar cheese weaved in there, and chopped green onions. I wasn\\'t crazy about the chicken sausage though.  ******************** UPDATE (1/11/13)  Set up is slightly different - now you order at your table (vs. cash register).  ROTISSERIE CHICKEN PENNE PASTA w/ BASIL PESTO - $12 Server raved about the pasta and the chicken pot pie, and I ended up getting the pasta. Huge bowl enough for 2-3 meals - so $12 isn\\'t bad when you think about it. Enjoyed my dish but not really all that special. I\\'d recommend the other dishes instead.  POUTINE - $6 Yay my co-worker let me sample hers. Duck fat fries, Amish cheese curds, chicken cravy. Great comfort food esp. for a cold rainy day.

Long story short: I was told I could obtain services & products in this retail location by SEVERAL (and I mean 4+) AT&T reps over the phone but this location was beyond incompetent.  When I actually went into the store and asked for help about my issue, two salesmen dashed to the upper level with a dismissive, \"I can\\'t help you with that\" comment to avoid doing any actual work.  (These guys proceeded to play with the demo phones and shoot the shit while several people stood waiting for help.)  The one salesman who said he could help me never even bothered looking up my account, he said he couldn\\'t do what AT&T had already told me was possible.  He knew the answer to all of my questions about eligibility and purchasing without even looking up my account, amazing!  I will never, ever visit this store again.  GO TO THE BROOKLINE LOCATION AT COOLIDGE CORNER, YOU WILL THANK ME.  Sorry about the caps, but it\\'s important.  The Coolidge Corner store employees bent over backwards to ensure that my iPhone 3G purchase was as smooth as possible and it was.  It was virtually painless, ridiculously speedy (sub-5 minutes), and the kind of experience I had expected all along.  They were nice, friendly, and helpful -- imagine that!

The marina has paddle boats for free and other activities but they all cost....leading me to my next  point, The resort has a lot to do, however, it all cost. This resort is a money trap. You even have to pay for wifi if more than one person is using it. All the events the resorts host have fees applied to it, and nothing is free.   Parking is horrendous and you will be forced to park in the parking deck.   The pools were nice but the jacuzzi jets were broken.

       " 'Visited  Wahlburger\\'s this past Saturday while on vacation in Boston. My friends and I thought it\\'d be a fun stop for a bite to eat but turned out to be the opposite. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever been to a \"restaurant\" that was more disorganized in my life. I\\'m not even sure where to begin. This place doesn\\'t know what it wants to be and it didn\\'t appear that anyone was bothering to manage it.  Upon entering, there was an employee in the vestibule, with people lined up on either side of the entryway. As the place looked packed I figured she was a hostess and approached to put my name on the list. She promptly yelled at me, saying that the people waiting on the side were before me. Not really sure how I\\'d know that never having been there and without her talking to any other customers. I figured they had already given their names and were waiting. When it was my turn she asked what I wanted, express service or wait service. I\\'m not sure about you, but I\\'d never heard that at a restaurant and had to ask what she meant. She explained that express service is essentially fast food service, which is quicker, as opposed to wait service. We were quoted 30 minutes for express and 60-90 minutes for table service so we went express - if you could call it that.   When all was said and done it took almost an hour to wait on line, order and receive our food. There was no organization to the service whatsoever, and they simply waited for one table to get up and leave before they would take another express order. We were a party of 5 and they said they had to see if they could put tables together for us. When we went over to whoever was supposed to seat the express customers she put us at two tables next to a window, seating us bar-style rather than putting us at either the other set of tables that were being pushed together in the middle of the room as we were waiting and then immediately divided again or the large, empty booth. At this point two kids who clearly hadn\\'t ordered just walked in and sat at the booth. The poor girl seating people tried to ask if they were eating and they rudely told her yes, even though they didn\\'t have a pager for their order. Without anyone there to support her she just said okay to them and told us to sit at the two tables pushed together at the window. By this time most of my party was frustrated and hungry and one of my friends freaked. They did remove the kids from the booth and seat us there, but only after him speaking in a way I\\'ve never experienced from my friend. (He did apologize and told the girl it wasn\\'t her but that this was rediculous). Add to this that after waiting on line to order for 45 min they THEN told us that alcohol had to be ordered at the bar only. Two friends went to the bar to get drinks, waited at the bar for about 10 min before they were told they needed to order by the waitress station since they weren\\'t sitting at the bar and then had to wait to odder while in the way of the wait staff. Classy.  Now, the food....overpriced burgers, fries and tots. I got the Thanksgiving sandwich. It wasn\\'t awful, but the bread to meat ratio was a joke (way too much bread between the bun and stuffing with only a thin turkey burger) and my fries were cold and very obviously sitting out for some time before being served. Serving size on fries also wasn\\'t worth nearly $4. We proceeded to watch the kitchen process as we were sitting adjacent to it and could see the fry cook was just pumping them out and sticking them on the top shelf under heat lamps, pushing the older fries forward as he added new fries. We also watched the girl take fries that were sitting in the front of the warming area for more than five minutes and serve them. Just what every customer wants - cold, stale fries. Even McDonald\\'s throws out product when it\\'s been sitting. Rather than cooking to order they were just pushing out product. Gross.   This place is a glorified fast food restaurant that can\\'t decide what it wants to be with over priced food and slow service. The owners need to pick a model (either a sit-down restaurant or fast food), stick to it and attempt to do it well. Hiring a competent manager or two would help, also. There had to be at least 15-20 workers there and we still waited an hour to eat and wound up with a bad service experience and below average food. I get that this place is a fad because of it\\'s family ties and we were there on a Saturday, but this was beyond excusable. I\\'d never go back or recommend this place. If the Wahlberg brothers are smart they\\'ll distance themselves from this mess before it implodes.',\n",

I politely declined and thanked them for the information.... I called them a few hours after and told them I just want to schedule the cleaning so I can be done with this for the next 6 months and after going back and forth about telling her I'm not paying $101 for a cleaning when my insurance covers it.

I was in heaven (I am a fanatic of grocery-shopping... yes, it\\'s bizarre) because of the abundance of produce and other products that they carried. I had just been at Great Wall on Pleasant Hill that very morning and I have developed the opinion that Asian grocery stores have fresher produce/meat/seafood at better price points than American counterparts. This supermarket competed very well with the Asian markets that I have been to, with the exception of hearing Mexican music and Spanish being spoken around you.  No worries for me, since I can speak Spanish quite fluently now. I wandered about the market to check out what they had and I ended up leaving with butternut squash, guava, and some lettuce. The lettuce was better priced than what I saw at Great Wall that morning. Bf is a huge guava lover and he picked these little baby-looking guavas (about 1-1.5\" in diameter) to bring home. I\\'ve had them over the past few days as they\\'ve ripened and they were delicious.

However you should probably make sure you\\'ve got a few minutes to kill - it took them about 15 minutes to prep our lunch, with no other customers inside.  They feature a bunch of lavash-ish wraps in typical \"middle-eastern\" style - falafel, shwarma, hummus, etc, with lettuce, tomato, pickle and tahini.  The wraps are dirt cheap - under $5 right now for a vegetarian option and $5-$7 for meat.  The wraps are also delicious, and they will even serve them to you out of the wrap and plated if you ask nicely.  There are some other plated options (mostly configurations of the above items) which we\\'ll have to go back to try.  These are a bit more expensive but are still less than $10.  The reason the wraps were so tasty was because the food was clearly cooked to order - a mixed bag at a place with counter service.  You expect the food to come out quick, so when you\\'re sitting waiting and listening to the falafel fry in the kitchen, it can be a little discouraging.  However, it was totally worth the wait.

The server, Michael, was perfect and should be a trainer for servers in other restaurants. He was informative, funny, paid us the right amount of attention and we really appreciated his service. We were able to sample one of the local microbrews (Queen City Brewery, Burlington, VT. -  South End Lager) and found it crisp and delicious. It is a light, blond lager that accentuates the German malt. Mildly hoppy, it was terrific and is highly recommended. The Sweet Potato Poutine appetizer is a killer combo. The sweet potato fries, duck confit and cheese curds make for an awesome combination. I swear the duck is quickly kissed by the fryolator to provide a light, crispy texture that compliments the rest of the duck meat. If you're in the mood for a few beers and an appetizer, this is the one. We had the Tavern Burger with lettuce, tomato and mayo. They forgot the mayo but this was quickly remedied with a small ramekin delivered to the table. The angus burger was cooked perfectly to order and the roll was excellent. The fries are very good and make the perfect accompaniment.  The Old School Cuban sandwich was excellent. The combination of the pulled pork, ham and pickles was on point. The ciabatta roll was soft and ideal for this sandwich. This diner chose the onion ring side dish and was not disappointed. The fry cook knows what he/she is doing as these were rings of gold. The batter was cooked to perfection, (OK, the way we like it) close to tan and not a hint of overdone. The third diner ordered the Chicken, Bacon and Waffles dinner. This southern style meal was impressively presented with all items stacked and skewered on a foundation of real mashed potatoes. Once deconstructed, each component was sampled and we could not decide what we liked better. The chicken was fried all the way to heaven with an awesome coating, the buttermilk waffles were crispy, the bacon and potatoes were exactly what was hoped for: crispy on the bacon, and smoothly whipped potatoes with hints of the skin mixed in.   Portion sizes on all meals would not disappoint even the hungriest of diners.  Though we shouldn't have, we decided to share one dessert. We chose the Bruleed Pound Cake. They start by loading the bowl with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream. On top of that is a mysterious and delicious concoction of pieces of pound cake and creme brulee including pieces of crispy caramelized sugar. They top this amazing dessert with a heaping amount of fresh whipped cream. This was perfectly sized for three people.   We will definitely return and look forward to sampling some of the other offerings.\",\n",
       " '**Best Vietnamese coffee anywhere. Great vermicelli bun and Pho **  We stopped in Saigon Noodle & Grill for lunch recently, and were pleasantly surprised. First off, the Vietnamese coffee, which the proprietors explain derives from the gentleman\\'s prior experience growing coffee in Vietnam, is unbelievably good -- rich and sweet and exceptionally dark and flavorful. Any fan of this style of coffee should go to Saigon Noodle and Grill immediately and sample it. It is simply fantastic.  The spring rolls were wonderful; large and full of huge shrimp and fresh veggies.   The specialty of the house is the selection of \"bird\\'s nest\" dishes. I understand the owners\\' justified pride in recommending we try these amazing concoctions, which comprise huge slabs of egg-fried rice cut into thick, biscuit-style triangles and arranged around a heaping collection of veggies, shrimp, chicken, and squid (depending on the dish chosen) on a bed of crispy noodles. One \"bird\\'s nest\" could easily feed two large, hungry people, or four looking for a light lunch. A little too much for us.  The pho, and the vermicelli bowls are outstanding. The pho is aromatic but doesn\\'t overdo the star anise. The vermicelli dishes come with an excellent spiced-up house fish sauce. Both are well worth the trip and will keep us coming back.  Anyone looking for Vietnamese food in the area owes these lovely people a visit.',\n",

However, my last purchase was horrible! I bought three 2lb packets of daal and all three were completely rotten and stinky. The moment i Opened the bags I had to throw it in trash to avoid puking! There was no date on the packets so I can't tell if it was past the use by date. I would think they would check the dates and not have old stinky groceries.

       " 'I\\'d been drove past FLIP last week and it appeared that they were open so I sent an email requesting their hours of operation. I quickly received an email back saying they would be open 12/10. The next day I received another email saying that they were accepting limited reservations for Friday night and I was welcome to make one.   I invited 2 of my girlfriends (fellow burger lovers) to come with me to see what Richard Blais had up his sleeve with this new restaurant. When we first got their the hostesses were very friendly and quick to offer their opinions as to what burger to order. As a matter of fact person that we encountered that worked their offered their suggestions as to which was the burger to order. Our server was very nice and accommodating.   The first thing we ordered were the fries, vodka onion rings, and the sweet potato tots. I thought the fries were pretty tasty, but the onion rings were not really my fave and the tots were crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside. I think I would have liked them better if they were more of the traditional \"tot\".   I ordered the Bun Mi which was a Vietnamese spicy pork sandwich with pickled veggies on top. VERY GOOD. I had a bite of the Southern which was a fried burger with pimento cheese. It wasn\\'t bad but not my fave.  I also ordered the Butcher which was my absolute fave very nice flavor combinations I would definitely order that again. Lastly I had the Krispy Kreme Shake, sounds a little weird but it was DELICIOUS! Best shake I\\'ve ever had. My friends wanted a taste and I honestly have to say I was watching how much they drank because I didn\\'t want to give up TOO much of my delicious drink.   We saw Richard Blais going from table to table talking to all of the patrons. He came by our table before he left for the night to see how we liked the food. Very genuine down to earth guy.    I would definitely go back to try the other burger concoctions that FLIP has to offer as well. BUT, this time I will remember not to eat anything all day so I dint feel back when I drink another one of those shakes. :-)',\n",
       " \"I've been hearing the hype for the last few years from just about everybody I know. Today was the day I turned the tables and finally join in on raving about this place.   A typical Portland breakfast nook, Tin Shed has a quirky aesthetic, down-to-earth servers, and a hurried vibe about the joint. I sat at the counter, where the waiters buzzed around like bees, without ever rushing me.   I had my stomach's heart set on the Salm I Am dish, but the waiter sold me on the daily special: a mushroom/art heart/sun-dried tomato/roasted garlic scramble topped with pesto and feta (!) cheese and served with a side of potato cakes and fresh made buttermilk biscuit. Um, yes please!  The scramble hit every tastebud, and left me wanting to devour my plate even faster. The potatoes were phenomenal, and don't even get me started on the biscuit! Topped with a spread of housemade raspberry jam, you can't go wrong. Even the orange juice was fancily hand pressed.   For a Monday morning, they were pretty busy. I'm sure I'll have to wait in line to try the lunch and/or happy hour menu. Nonetheless, Tin Shed goes on the favorites list.\",\n",
       " \"You're going to find the reviews all over the map for this place, because it's a strange sort of place, and because expectations can be everything.  My review only covers the outside seating, so if you're looking to sit indoors, hit up some of the other reviews.  I love this place because it offers me EXACTLY what I want, which is tons of local and fresh shellfish in a fun setting right on the water.  They have everything from lobster, oysters, clams, crawfish and more are available. The food is always prepared just how I like it, oysters shucked properly and lobster still steaming.  There is nothing like sitting by the water with lobster, oysters, steamers and beer.    I always skip just about everything else, because none of it is good to me.  My wife and I do like the crab cakes, but aside from that I find the non-shellfish options to be mediocre to middle range.  Don't come here expecting great service or ambience.  I asked for a shell cracker and the waitress tossed a dirty boulder on the table.  She served us warm beers and didn't check in for a while.  It's always crowded, takes forever to get a seat, and sometimes you have to sit next to a picnic table of screaming kids and tourists.  This place is perfectly Boston.  It's crowded and dirty and rude, but there's just something special about it.  If you like shellfish, and you are adventurous, give it a try.\",\n",

Again, I was only getting gift cards but I observed the following. The store as usual was packed. The line was long and they had a good amount of help. This is actually a good thing. Employees seemed polite to the customer from what I could hear. Many people were dining in. The drink area looked very clean and it might have been since I did see an employee cleaning off the tables. I walked up to the register and was greeted right away. Although the young girl was helping someone complete their order I was still greet right away. The employee was very polite to me and helpful. I would for sure be back again, this time for food. The only reason not 5 stars was because I did not purchase food, which I am quite sure I will give them that 5 stars rating once I have tried the food.',\n",

The waiter was friendly and attentive, always refilling our waters, etc.    There's a lot more seating here than at other places, comparable to Cha on 21st.  They have a giant outdoor patio that I'm sure would be a wonderful place to drink a margarita.  The menu is identical to the other Cha Cha Cha locations, same prices, etc.  A fresh vegan burrito with tempeh!

I had the Filet Mignon Grilled medium rare, Jumbo Asparagus, Roasted Fingerling Parslied Potato, Seared Cauliflower and Classic Au Poivre Sauce, I enjoyed it. I also tried the Blueberry Buck drink which consisted of Hangar One Blueberry, Fresh Lime, Simple Syrup, Barritt's Ginger Beer and Shaved Nutmeg - it was very good.

All located on the first floor.  2nd floor you will find clothes for men, women and children. Not much to chose from. I was not impressed with the women's selection!

       " \"It's smaller than I expected, area-wise, but there is certainly a lot of things packed in here. Plenty to look at, the vendors are kind of sporadically placed, and I had to loop around at least twice to make sure I didn't miss anything.  Unique gifts and decorations to spare, but to be totally honest, I really only came here for the food. There's lots of delicious eats, from bratwurst with onions and sauerkraut, to chocolate fondue, to caramel popcorn, and more. That being said, I suggest you come here looking to snack, not to eat, as everything is on the pricey side. It's not so expensive that you will ignore the tempting aromas around you and leave hungry, but the cost is steep enough that you will probably grumble with dissatisfaction as you forfeit your shekels.  Ix-nay on the smoking inside the market, but as busy as it was, I was able to duck in and out several times for puffs with no fuss and no waiting.  It's five dollars at the door, which I think is a little high considering not only the admission prices of other markets, but the asking prices of the vendors. That being said, I like the fact that it's a one time fee, and your admission earns you a re-entry pass for the rest of the season.  All in all, I was surprised how fun and interesting this was. With one re-entry pass for me and one for the manfriend tucked safely away in my wallet, I will surely ignore the cheap in me at least one more time, and return for another sampling (food first, everything else second). However, I do think that the cost to value ratio is off in a way that does not favor me, and for that reason, I can't give it a higher rating.\",\n",

I should have canceled my order once I saw the plate of shawarma being placed in the microwave. The chicken was dry bland chunks of meat similar to canned chicken. Beef n lamb was worse, a sour aftertaste and very dry. I ate two pieces each of meat to confirm I was not mistaken about the food, ate one slice of hard pita, spoonful of cucumber salad. Then dumped the whole plate of food in trash. Did not bother discussing or arguing with owners about the bad food.

I'm not talking taquerias, of which we have an abundance of solid entries.  And I'm not talking fancy Portland-style restaurants like Taqueria Nueve (R.I.P.).  I'm talking about a place that gives you delicious chips and salsa up front, has great chile verde and colorado, some tasty flat steaks, and more.  Well, this is the place.  But add in a ton of mariscos (seafood dishes).  Obviously their specialty is things from the sea.  I'm getting around to there, but it's tough to get past my cravings for my staple: chile verde.  There's is delicious, tangy and tender.  I had the chicken fajita last night and it came out sizzling, served on cast iron over a candle.  Holy cow they were fantastic.  The lady got fish tacos, bass I think, not battered or deep fried, but floured and grilled.  They were grub as well.  Served on a massive plate with plenty of rice and beans.  The margarita (rocks, salt) was very good.  Not too sweet, a problem I have far too often.  The salsa is pretty good.  Not amazing, unfortunately, but good enough to keep momentum.  I request the picante salsas, and they bring a red and a green.  Both are very thin, but really flavorful.  The green tastes like essence of lime and jalapeno.  The red is smoky and nice.  They also serve the crispy chips with refried bean dip, a nice touch.  The mariscos look excellent.  You can spend a fair amount on a plate (ranges from 12 to 25).

I used not one, but two agents from this agency, and both were the ideal candidates for buying a home.  Initially, I met with Andrew McKinney, who was much more accommodating and experienced than I was expecting.  I only say that because this was my first time buying a home and did not know what to expect.  Andrew was able to address questions I did not even know I had and clarified exactly what what to happen throughout the process. Andrew recommended an initial meeting to make sure we both could work together, which you should do, even though not everyone does it.    Andrew ended up taking a trip early on during the search which led me to another, equally experienced agent within the BBO family, Christine Smith.

I never had to wait more than a day to hear back regarding questions that I had, and there were tons!  Having worked in a customer orientated position in the past, I deeply value the attention that was provided, and know that it is rare.  The best part was that when I did get answers, they were always honest, without any ulterior motives.  If you are buying a home, you should value honesty and the \"upfrontness\" that you will get from anyone at BBO.  That is an obvious way to know that they are on your side and have your best interests in mind.  During the actual viewings, I was given great feedback about the properties, truly showing the knowledge and expertise that each possessed.  Where I got over excited, and possibly showed how green I was to the process, I was quickly grounded by detailed explanations and reasons, which was amazingly helpful.  Everyone at BBO is actually working for you, and not themselves for the entire process and will not try to get you into a place just to make a commission.  They are working for your best interests!

I will definitely be coming back next year!\",\n",
       " \"This is a mixed review for their food and service.  The Taiwanese brunch is fantastic. Really really good pork belly buns, turnip cakes, soup dumplings, beef noodle soup, soy milk, crullers, you name it. The lines that form outside in any kind of weather attest to how good the brunch is.   For dinner and lunch, they are average. There are a few really good dishes, a few below average, hence an average rating here.   For take out, something happens to their food on the way out the door. The vegetables get soggy, the sauces congeal, the oil separates. I'm not sure why, but the take out is exceptionally bad, even if the dish is good if eaten in-house.  The wait staff are super sweet, and yes, as some reviewers have said, no-nonsense when they are busiest at brunch time. Go when they are less busy and you'll see how nice these women are. The owners on the other hand are awful. They are an older woman and her son who usually work the cash register. The woman is super rude, never smiles, never greets and never says thank you, and the son is worse. We once called from the road to order brunch take and the son refused to take the order over the phone. We had an hour before we had to head onto our next plans, which we explained to him. He told us that there would be no wait and we should just come to the restaurant to order. When we arrived, we put in our ordered and paid, and then he told us it would be a 45 min wait. We wanted to cancel our order, and he lied and said it would be 10-15 minutes. Well, we ended up waiting 45 minutes. I understand that restaurant kitchens get busy but he should have told us this on the phone. He outright lied to us with no remorse.\",\n",

For a second time, they served flour instead of corn tortillas with the taco despite the option to order as corn. The tacos had lettuce and orange cheese a-la-the taco bell. When the check came, the pen didn't work. I'll stay away in the future.\",\n",

The last place I expected to find authentic Mexican food was in the middle of tourist Hell on 192 in Kissimmee.  Thanks to the previous Yelpers who reviewed this place... I would have never noticed it.  You knew the place was legit when you walk in and there's a dude with a makeshift desk selling cheap knock off colognes.  I went with the fajitas... $13!  And man they were great.  Chips and salsa were solid.  My friend had a cheaper lunch, about $8 and was fully satisfied.  Definitely will be back next time I'm in Orlando.    Only minor complaint is I'll echo what others say about the service being a little slow.  But it wasn't big enough of an issue to drop a star... this place is excellent.\",\n",

Yes, 7 days a week. Even though this area doesn't open until 10 am on weekdays and 11 on weekends Atlantic Station insists on this thing starting between 7 and 7:30. It's the worst noise, I've tried earplugs, white noise, nothing covers its noise. We deal with sewage pumping in the middle of the night as well which is also crazy loud. If you work nights run the other way! You'll never sleep again! The management company is awful and couldn't care less about anything. We were given two parking spots but of course our awful neighbor left a scratch and white dent on my brand new car because her large SUV doesn't fit in her parking spot. Management gave us 2 new spots however these spots still belonged to someone else. We let the manager know and he took his sweet time figuring it out. Now I deal with this gross stuff that leaks on my car from the crack above. This place is just awful! It's been stressful and the manager has zero ability to put himself in anyone's shoes. We've also tried to talk to his management which also ignores us. My guess, they get so many complaints that that can't deal anymore. Unfortunately for us we still have a lot on our lease but as soon as it's up we'll be running out of here and will never come back and will recommend this place to nobody!\",\n",

The food was totally worth it and the atmosphere was nice.  Loved every bite.  So glad to have a pizza restaurant like this in town.  The lack of 5 stars is due to the service.  We must have had the same server as mentioned by another reviewer.  She was great in the beginning as she promptly took our order and delivered our food and drinks efficiently but then disappeared.  Even though the restaurant wasn't busy, she seemed preoccupied in back or by the tablet computer in back and when she walked by she never made eye contact so we couldn't get her attention order another round or check to see if we needed anything else.  When she finally did check in we were done eating and had empty glasses for our beer, wine and water.  Not sure if Bambolina offers dessert either since she never offered.  I think this will be great for take out and hopefully the server we had gets some more training.\",\n",

On this last occasion, we came in before I worked an event in the area. I skipped lunch earlier because I was working, and needed good food fast. Plus, boyfriend wanted to watch the football game, and T-Mac definitely has enough screens to choose from.  I ordered the Sante Fe Wrap, which I've had before but not since they redid the menu. I didn't read the description correctly, and it came out with a ton of rice inside the wrap. And it was really thick, fluffy rice at that. I had to scrape a lot out because it became too starchy too quickly. But overall it was good and I ended up full before going to work.  Boyfriend got the wings, like he usually does. Another perk about T-Mac is they're really nice about letting you split sauces, even on small orders. And, this location has pretty good fry cooking techniques. The last location we went to, by Phillips Arena, gave us soggy fries.  My main complaint with the experience was the fact that I didn't get the hard cider I wanted; this is more on the POS/management side than an issue with our server. I asked for a seasonal Woodchuck, and the server brought me the traditional Amber instead. When we brought this to her attention, she said they don't sell a lot of the seasonal and it's not in the walk-in. So they don't have a button for it. So... why have it on the beer list if there's not a way for the server to ring it in correctly and for the bartender to pull the correct drink? Doesn't make sense. I wish I had brought it up to the manager while I was there.  Overall it's not a bad place. Good for watching sports and drinking a ton of different beers.\",\n",

One week later, my gorgeous new glasses came in the mail! Please understand that I know what good glasses are and how they should fit. I've been in glasses forever and have bought just about every designer at one point or another. And these really are GREAT glasses.

At 7pm, I walked into the place and stood in front of the register while the manager/cashier ignored my friend and I for a good three to four minutes. Meanwhile, a line had formed behind us about eight deep. Still, this manager moved like he had not a care in the world.  Finally he looks up and says \"If you aint\\' here for takeout we closed.\"  I said, \"Why are you closed at 7?\"  He replied, \"We out of dough.\"  Now, I\\'m sure you don\\'t hire your managers based upon their language skills, but when you\\'re in a role which will be interacting with customers, at least being able to have a short, simple conversation without sounding completely illiterate is nice.  This guy didn\\'t offer an apology, didn\\'t act like he gave a rat\\'s a--, and what kind of pizza place offers special deals for a specific day and then doesn\\'t order enough supplies to cover it?  I\\'ll be contacting their corporate, because this was just a horrible experience all around.',\n",

Needless to say it was delicious.\",\n",
       " \"Decide to stop in after reading a few Yelp reviews. The restaurant is in a dead or near dying shopping center and this lends to it's divey ambiance which is one of the things I like about it. Most Thai restaurants that I've been to in the city and elsewhere typically have a semi-formal feel to them but not Zab-E-Lee. This atmosphere of this place would work well in a Little 5 Points type setting. Anyway, too the food, I had the chicken spring rolls and a green papaya salad with sticky rice. The spring rolls were good but nothing to slap your momma about, just good. I really enjoyed the green papaya salad though. The veggies were fresh and crunchy and the dressing was well-balanced, not too sweet and not to sour, just right. I got the salad Thai spicy, which was three Thai chilis on the menu. I love spicy foods but Thai spicy was just on the border of being too spicy for me, but I finished everything nonetheless, and it was delicious, so be warned when ordering, err on the side of less spicy until you know what you are dealing with. Other than that, the waitress was very friendly and attentive and as I was leaving the owner and chef thanked me for coming. I'll definitely go back to try some of the other dishes.\",\n",

I was charged accordingly, which means much less than I expected to pay.   Mike is smart, affable, and an all-around great guy. I never thought I'd be in the position to rave about a locksmith, but Mike is truly deserving.\",\n",

After about 10 minutes of standing around, I walked to the other side that was vacant with 2 employees at the registers, but no customers. I asked if I could order at either side, (remember this is not the dine-in side) and they said yes. I'm just confused why they let me stand on the other side for 10 minutes. Oh well.  Everything else went great! I highly recommend trying Newk's if you haven't before! Their sandwiches are amazing.   I got the italian and my lady got the grilled steak. We both left stuffed and satisfied!\",\n",

The attendant told us to drive a few miles to the Peach Valley Cafe and so glad we did! We arrived around 11ish and the place was busy but were seated within 15 min. I ordered the quiche ( tomato, basil, cheese) served with fresh fruit. Hubster ordered valley omellette served with grits. Our waiter stated the grits were regular Quaker grits but  cooked with heavy cream. The grits cooked this way were delicious, different than southern style grits. The apple fritters with strawberry yogurt heavenly.  Our waiter, Brendon was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly.',\n",

I had some very specific requirements on how i wanted the tables set up and they worked with me and we got it. Also allowing us to come in and taste the food and wines and beer, so we could decide what to put on the menu was awesome and everything we tasted was amazing, including the pizza.

The bubble tea was good, and the bubble waffle was so tasty and delicious. But the wait was a bit long.   The second visit, was around 7 pm and there was the same amount of customers from my first visit; not many to serve. Again, the bubble tea was served quickly and was good. Ordered a waffle, and I waited 45 minutes. I finally asked about it, but the servers forgot to make it. I waited another extra minutes for it to be made. They gave me a free discount for the wait. The waffle was also not made well, almost uncooked. Was super disappointed.\",\n",

You really cant get a better Banh Mi in town for $4.  I love these types of sandwiches and I go there every day now.  Seriously, you got the wrong sandwich.

       " \"I feel terrible not loving this place. Heard amazing things about it. Decided to try to out since I live nearby and have been loyal to Coco for so long.   Got the Avocado Green Tea with boba. I know that choice was probably not THE VERY but I'm assuming they'd put something as their special for a reason. They must have trial tasted this right? Ironic because this bubble tea lacked MILK & SUGAR. I eventually threw it out because I couldn't take how bland and matcha it tasted. I was imagining something milky. It literally was avocado, ice and some matcha powder/green tea blended.   The boba was chewy and definitely my preference but not sweet as well. I understand they need to cater to people who don't like sweets but mannn. Not my thing. Giving them 2 stars for value and space in the store. Parking is horrendous up front, you could probably get away with parking across the street.   I might come back and try something else but for now I'm definitely turned off and it's gonna have to be a no from me :(\",\n",

Other ales at lunch wee their Pilsner which was really good & their Scottish Ale.  All pictured - Christmas Ale is the darkest.  Our table had 4 of their sandwiches all of which were great served with homemade potato chips, potato salad, cole slaw or macaroni salad.  If you get the chips add a side of their homemade chip dip. Only thing that could be construed as a negative was the container for the potato salad, it was smaller than liked because it was sooo good.\",\n",

I was asked to move to the back room because, according to the barista, the restaurant was getting full while there were only a couple of people occupying a single table. I'd go back but mostly for takeout.\",\n",
       " \"I wandered in one Saturday night and the place was empty. I wasn't expecting much as a result, but I was so wrong!  I opted to order à la carte rather than getting a combo - the prices were very reasonable either way. I went with the miso soup to start, which was pretty standard, yet somehow tasted better than I expected.  The salmon sashimi was very fresh and served in generous portions.    But the highlight was honestly the mango roll.  It comes wrapped in rice (no seaweed) and topped with avocado and drizzled in some sort of mayo.  It tasted delicious and didn't even need tamari, ginger, or wasabi.  Highly recommended!  Only downside: the restaurant did eventually fill up, leaving the one and only server run off her feet. She did the best she could in the circumstances and apologised profusely for delays, but a second server would have made life easier for everyone!\",\n",
       " \"I love Costco. There are, however, a few things I would choose to improve.    Most notably: difficulty sharing a house membership. We're college students. We live together. However, these are not our permanent addresses, and we aren't related.  It'd still be nice to be able to have some different people shop every week rather than me always going.  Additionally, not taking credit cards other than AmEx is very sad.  The parking lot is always awful. And I always manage to get inside before remember I have to grab a cart BEFORE going in.  Of course, you can't argue with: samples, $1.50 hot dog and drink, and some of the great things they have there. I hear other Costco's have Dunkaroos, which makes me a bit sad at mine, but I still haven't had a bad shopping experience there.\",\n",

Beautiful atmosphere and the dining room is spacious. Even when the restaurant is full, it doesn't feel crowded. Both times, the wait staff has been attention, friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating with the food and drink. I have had many brunches, mainly in Chicago, yet even compared to those restaurants Wolfs ridge has been my favorite!\",\n",

Very interesting as this place is located on the second floor .. the front door opens into a dark waiting area ... with candles and sofas and a cart in the middle of the room w ice and cups for the fruit infused water.  After being seated, the waiter goes over their caviar and wine list.   Then he hands you the menu \"road map\" to your tasting menu.  After we paid the bill, he offered us the detailed menu.  The food was excellent.  The sushimi was very fresh - the waiter noted it was from Hawaii and the king salmon and sea-bass was cooked to perfection.  Each dish was delicious.  We would highly recommend this restaurant - we had a 6 pm reservation and by 8pm the place was full.    There was 4 seats at the counter .. chefs table - if you don\\'t mind sitting by the counter - it may be nice.  The entire meal was a bit 3 hours.  They paste each dish really well.',\n",

We got oysters, cod, and shrimp as well as the strawberry basil shrub.   The atmosphere was lovely - we sat upstairs and it overlooks the water. The oysters were great, and the cod was delicious. The shrimp was served on a brioche bun, with lettuce, and tomato (surprising) - it was yummy, but there were like 5 shrimps, I mean...I guess I expected a bit more.   The strawberry basil was refreshing and delightful. Perfect for summer. Would definitely return.',\n",

I  expected way better service than that.   I messaged the owner of the business about my experiences in hopes that they would address the issue cause frankly yolks is one of my fav places to eat.  Just can't resist those lemon potatoes.    Sadly, the owner said he would address my concerns and get back to me but never did. Very sad since he stated in his message that issues like this are important to address and thanked me for contacting him first before writing a negative review, especially since they were a small local business.    Well  sorry to say that I've had to write this review as I've had no contact and felt my concerns were brushed to the side.    No more yolks for me.\",\n",

My friend ordered a beef dish, white rice and bean sauce and was very satisfied with her meal as well. The serving of food was very generous for the price. I was so full! Despite it being busy, our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The waitresses were all very nice and approachable. Our waitress could've been a bit more attentive to our table though. The music and the ambiance was great overall. I'll be coming back to this place for sure!\",\n",

Everything was just phenomenal. Staff, food, ambiance... everything. I can not recommend enough, especially for a great celebratory spot.\",\n",
       " \"Been here twice. It's more upscale than Chili's, and it has a wide selection of food. Nice interior, friendly staff. My burger was very good. My only gripe was that the place was mostly empty (Saturday afternoon, rainy day), and the hostess sat us right next to the one-and-only big table with a bunch of noisy women, and we were directly under the music speaker. She didn't mind when we moved a few tables away. But the place was 90% empty! Why not just spread out the guests? Overall, a decent place.  It's easy to get to (on 114, between the North Shore Shopping Center and Rte 1), but you're taking your life in your hands if you want to exit the parking lot and turn left of 114 :-)\",\n",

They called back to say that one of the items in my order went against my food allergy. Delivery driver went to the wrong town and had to call five times to get the right address. I repeated my address to him several times and he kept insisting he was outside, even though he wasn't even in the right town. Ages later my food finally arrived. They charged me for the item that had to be removed from the order, even though they took it off the order. The food was okay, but the staff here is pretty incompetent, caused me a major inconvenience and over charged. This place is awful. Won't go back.\",\n",
